2023-11-29 14:24:54 Recieved message: Does anyone’s mt4,5 say instant execution. Rather than market execution like everyone else.
2023-11-29 14:24:59 Recieved message: At least you have access 😅
2023-11-29 14:25:59 Recieved message: I did before but now I don’t, spoke too soon 😂
2023-11-29 14:25:59 Recieved message: 😂😂😂 … let’s hope we’ll be able to access soon
2023-11-29 14:26:59 Recieved message: Mines say market execution
2023-11-29 14:26:59 Recieved message: Mine does but I use mt5

2023-11-29 14:28:59 Recieved message: Feel like I’m the only one that’s says instant execution. Everyone else has market. 🤔 does it make a difference
2023-11-29 14:28:59 Recieved message: Yea  I’m using mT5
2023-11-29 14:28:59 Recieved message: But even on my mt4 it says instant instead of market.
2023-11-29 14:28:59 Recieved message: Not me trading 5
2023-11-29 14:29:59 Recieved message: I don’t think I ever seen instant execution before 🤔
2023-11-29 14:29:59 Recieved message: Dang that’s weird
2023-11-29 14:29:59 Recieved message: Hmmm hopefully someone with more experience can answer that.

2023-11-29 14:37:00 Recieved message: So after reading there is a slight difference. Maybe it could be I don’t have a broker in mt5 yet I’m still using the mt5 demo
2023-11-29 14:37:59 Recieved message: 
2023-11-29 14:37:59 Recieved message: Nvm it makes a big difference
2023-11-29 14:39:54 Recieved message: Ah maybe why than because of its a demo acc i had that also but now i am trading live
2023-11-29 14:40:59 Recieved message: Ahh okay
2023-11-29 14:41:59 Recieved message: Anyone who is currently using Masari … how are you working your live account ? I cannot add Masari as a broker to MT4 Mobile or MT4 Web .
2023-11-29 14:45:59 Recieved message: Try MT5
2023-11-29 14:48:59 Recieved message: I tried too but broker doesn’t show. Look into Nash markets with tradelocker 🙏🏽
2023-11-29 14:48:59 Recieved message: Just tried again on MT5 and Masari doesn’t come up yet. I don’t think they transferred over yet .

2023-11-29 17:04:01 Recieved message: Question: Will a trade ever close on its own or will it keep running indefinitely until it either hits T/P or S/L or if its manually closed?
2023-11-29 17:05:01 Recieved message: a trade never closes on its own until you close it
2023-11-29 17:05:01 Recieved message: or hit st
2023-11-29 17:06:01 Recieved message: Awesome! Thank you!
2023-11-29 17:06:01 Recieved message: So for a t/p we’ll have to close manually
2023-11-29 17:06:01 Recieved message: Yes or no
2023-11-29 17:06:16 Recieved message: Mine have always closed automatically once T/P is hit
2023-11-29 17:09:01 Recieved message: Tp closes automatically just like sl…you can close manually though before it hits tp or sl
2023-11-29 17:09:55 Recieved message: If you want the trade to run to T/P2, 3.. ect., then you have to modify the trade and change the T/P limit before it hits and closes correct?
2023-11-29 17:16:02 Recieved message: Yes that’s correct
2023-11-29 17:16:02 Recieved message: Thanks Hannah
2023-11-29 17:16:02 Recieved message: Sometimes people take multiple trades with different take profits for this reason, so that they don’t have to modify in the future.
2023-11-29 17:16:16 Recieved message: But that’s risky if the trade goes the other way right?
2023-11-29 17:18:01 Recieved message: Yes it definitely can be. Proper risk management has to be accounted for very well.
2023-11-29 17:19:01 Recieved message: Gotcha!
