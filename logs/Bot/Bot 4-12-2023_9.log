2023-12-04 14:05:05 Recieved message: Yup, this happened to me before. I entered exactly when they did and they said TP but it hit SL for me. I’ve had more gains with them than losses though but still it’s strange.
2023-12-04 14:05:05 Recieved message: That is so odd. Mine is going down like they said. Who's your broker?
2023-12-04 14:06:05 Recieved message: Or sometimes they say TP and mines would still be running

2023-12-04 14:08:05 Recieved message: Oh OK. I have finesse. Maybe that's the issue. I put in 2 trades from that and they both hit
2023-12-04 14:09:05 Recieved message: Now they say tp1 just hit +110. Maybe they were saying +70 at that point of time
2023-12-04 14:09:05 Recieved message: Yeah I also have finesse, but a demo account. I’m gonna switch over after I play around with it for awhile.
2023-12-04 14:10:05 Recieved message: The spreads are pretty good for finesse.
2023-12-04 14:10:05 Recieved message: And commissions aren't that bad either
2023-12-04 14:10:05 Recieved message: I have never changed brokers so much in my life 😂. Ever since this Masari mess I feel like I had like 4 different brokers already lol.
2023-12-04 14:12:05 Recieved message: I know right 🤣. I switched 3xs 😆 glad they found us one.  It's awesome to see the customers come first
2023-12-04 14:13:05 Recieved message: Yeah it’s been so much going on. Even Hankotrade is having issues with MT4/MT5 mobile. I had to open my live account on the PC until they resolve whatever is going on.
2023-12-04 14:14:05 Recieved message: When was last manara update
2023-12-04 14:14:05 Recieved message: I'm sorry to hear that. People can't even find that broker on mt4/mt5
2023-12-04 14:16:05 Recieved message: Yeah I talked with support and they told me their team is working on it to get it back on there, it’s a minor inconvenience but patience is key.
2023-12-04 14:17:05 Recieved message: At this rate I’m just like “finesse, I’m coming home baby” 😂

I'm back at even now
2023-12-04 14:24:20 Recieved message: Damn I know you was mad af but glad you got it back 🫡
2023-12-04 14:25:05 Recieved message: I’m practicing for another week on demo then ima go live 🙌 but thanks for the recommendation definitely will get finesse
2023-12-04 14:26:00 Recieved message: Omg was I. The entire time in my demo I let everything ride and was 75-80% successful. And the first trade I took I went opposite 😆 but I'm also glad I got it back. Thank God for Gold!
2023-12-04 14:26:00 Recieved message: You're welcome.
2023-12-04 14:28:05 Recieved message: Gold is so rewarding man. It’s my favorite thing. Can be very volatile but super rewarding.
2023-12-04 14:29:05 Recieved message: Take your time but remember it's 90% mental, take the trade n let ride. You'll win n lose some. Always trust your gut

2023-12-04 14:32:05 Recieved message: That was one of their own trades as well not an alert.
2023-12-04 14:33:05 Recieved message: Yes it can just have to be a little cautious with gold
2023-12-04 14:33:05 Recieved message: Oh I know, it’s so inspiring to see stuff like that.
2023-12-04 14:33:05 Recieved message: Yes it is. Time to learn the gold charts. Nothing else 😆
2023-12-04 14:34:05 Recieved message: Yup I was always told to stick to one good pair you like and just go with that, trading a million different pairs can be confusing imo.

2023-12-04 15:48:07 Recieved message: The trades in manara or any trade for the matter doesn't mean you'll always win. Choose trades that are high risk/reward and trades that are in entry or slightly out of entry. Then let it ride
2023-12-04 15:48:07 Recieved message: Change the background.

I just change from light to dark and all was in color like you see.
2023-12-04 15:49:06 Recieved message: Also your lot size as well
2023-12-04 15:49:07 Recieved message: You still need to look at the chart and determine if the trade meets your trading plan or not

TBH Eacho has been a pain, I've been pulling my hair trying to get it set up and am sending requests and emails daily 😵‍💫
2023-12-04 17:00:08 Recieved message: Hmmm that’s so strange, maybe you have to close everything out and retry or contact support in your back office and see what they can do.
2023-12-04 17:01:11 Recieved message: Min is working just fine i am logging in with my phone so maybe you must contact support

2023-12-04 17:08:13 Recieved message: At what time did you “accept” before the trade happen?

2023-12-04 17:32:44 Recieved message: She didn’t accept the trade is what she’s trying to say. We get notifications asking us to “agree for trade execution” through telegram
2023-12-04 17:33:26 Recieved message: I would definitely be patiently waiting for a tutorial on eacho on how to properly execute trades and such. Would be so beneficial if there is one!
