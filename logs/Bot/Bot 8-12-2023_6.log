2023-12-08 10:38:05 Recieved message: This is MetaTrader 5… what is deviation and am I supposed to leave that blank or put zero when placing a trade.
2023-12-08 10:39:06 Recieved message: Also, is instant execution the same as in MT4’s market execution
2023-12-08 10:40:05 Recieved message: Yes
2023-12-08 10:40:05 Recieved message: Just switched over to MT5 today…
2023-12-08 10:40:05 Recieved message: Yes sgree
2023-12-08 10:40:05 Recieved message: And what about deviation?
2023-12-08 10:41:05 Recieved message: I don’t think mt5 has tht
2023-12-08 11:30:06 Recieved message: In MetaTrader 5, deviation refers to the maximum difference allowed between the requested price and the executed price when placing a trade. If you want to place a trade without any deviation, you can leave it blank or put zero. As for instant execution, it is similar to market execution in MT4. It means that your trade will be executed at the best available price in the market at that moment. Hope that helps clarify things for you📈

2023-12-08 14:33:05 Recieved message: What ?
2023-12-08 14:39:09 Recieved message: This
2023-12-08 14:47:09 Recieved message: This have 1 stop loss of 2040 and 3 different areas/points to TP. Choose 1 tp for the trade or u can do 3 different positions for each TP....using proper risk management ocourse. If that's what ur asking
2023-12-08 14:49:09 Recieved message: Okay but I saying thou how do input this stop loss and to in the mt4 because when I do enter in it’s not taking the execution I was wondering if it’s the case I was doing it wrong at the time
2023-12-08 14:52:09 Recieved message: I think there is a video in ECA that better explains
2023-12-08 14:53:09 Recieved message: Go to gold and put in a sell trade, then go back to the gold trade under trade tab then click on gold, modify it then out sl and tp in. SL has to be 2045 and tp can be example 2007
2023-12-08 14:57:09 Recieved message: Okay thanks but is it the case when I see a sell or a buy trade I use market execution if there is not entry price limit only Sl and Tp ?
2023-12-08 14:58:54 Recieved message: Correct. Market Execution is where you enter the trade at that moment. Pick your lot size then pick buy/sell then go back and modify your trade, thats where you enter your SL and TP. Fast way of getting in a trade when they say to. Make more money that way.
