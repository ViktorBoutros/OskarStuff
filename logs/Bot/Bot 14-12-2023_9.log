2023-12-14 09:54:35 Recieved message: Does anyone know how I can change my lot size on meta trader 5 on a demo account ?

2023-12-14 14:44:39 Recieved message: Thank you!! 🥰
2023-12-14 15:09:40 Recieved message: Minding everybody business except his I bet...no proper risk management....he preaches about not using SL....don't be like him 😂😂
2023-12-14 15:17:40 Recieved message: ?
2023-12-14 15:55:41 Recieved message: 
2023-12-14 15:58:40 Recieved message: So called "expert " on gold? Yeah ok... my account is gone. 1000 gone. Removing the sl. Are you fing kidding me. Last time I take an 'experts' advice.
2023-12-14 16:01:40 Recieved message: Who told you to do that? Lol
2023-12-14 16:02:40 Recieved message: You know about risk , use the proper risk managment . 

Noone is 100% expert here . Its has been crazy news YESTERDAY on gold . Its very risky to not have stop loss .
2023-12-14 16:02:40 Recieved message: Ploutos told us to remove sl til today. But whatever all good.
2023-12-14 16:03:40 Recieved message: No one should let out alerts when there is news.
2023-12-14 16:03:40 Recieved message: I took my stop loss off but basically just moved it to the absolute max I was willing to lose… didn’t want to blow my funded account. Still sucks but it’s on us to manage our risk.
2023-12-14 16:03:40 Recieved message: Rather be in small loss than blew account for future 🙌
2023-12-14 16:03:40 Recieved message: I guess it would have to be a very very small lot size with enough funds to cover the swings of the market until it can move back towards take profit
2023-12-14 16:05:36 Recieved message: Probably just not worth it to trade during news though, unless you’re right on the charts monitoring by the second 🤷🏼‍♀️
2023-12-14 16:05:36 Recieved message: Sorry to hear about your losses Nic!
2023-12-14 16:06:40 Recieved message: Nothing I can do about it.
2023-12-14 16:06:40 Recieved message: I appreciate that though
2023-12-14 16:07:40 Recieved message: I usually try to avoid trading on big impact news.
2023-12-14 16:07:40 Recieved message: Sad that this happened to you Nic :(
2023-12-14 16:08:41 Recieved message: 
2023-12-14 16:08:41 Recieved message: I understand that but why put out an alert when he knows the news was going on? He's been doing this awhile and he knows how many people take his alerts. But all good. My fault

2023-12-14 16:14:41 Recieved message: He does not have to put any alerts out. He can say no alert today due to the news. Being new I learned a lesson.
2023-12-14 16:17:41 Recieved message: That money will come back ten fold ! ✨
2023-12-14 16:18:41 Recieved message: I actually looked at my trade it's still going on. I'm letting it go. What else can I do
2023-12-14 16:21:15 Recieved message: This energy ! ❣️ Amen💯
2023-12-14 16:22:41 Recieved message: 
2023-12-14 16:23:41 Recieved message: I still hope that gold will go down before blew my account,because i didn't make sl. 😔
2023-12-14 16:25:41 Recieved message: Ok. That's your opinion because Ralph went onto his channel and said he's done for the week unless manara says something. So yeah....
2023-12-14 16:25:41 Recieved message: Hell nooo😭😭😭😭😭
2023-12-14 16:26:41 Recieved message: I'll take a pause from Pluto because i'm also a begginer, still learning and yea I also lost trades, not one but few by removing stop loss. So far I also earned money from Pluto, so it's still good to have it in my opinion, just won't be using it until I practice a little more and till the whole news and new year thing passes.
2023-12-14 16:27:41 Recieved message: I think it’s just been these two days so far
2023-12-14 16:27:41 Recieved message: The market is usually predictable in other days
2023-12-14 16:27:41 Recieved message: I know now that everytime need put sl. I'm lucky that is small account.
2023-12-14 16:34:21 Recieved message: GUYSSS , our guy Eric just opened his live act today and has made $108 🔥 congratulations on starting your live act daily goal for today was reached 🫡😮‍💨

2023-12-14 17:09:42 Recieved message: Yep this is true he said not to trade yesterday and he also said to chill for the week
2023-12-14 17:14:42 Recieved message: Yeah bro I took mines off but put it back on, I was too nervous fr
2023-12-14 17:19:42 Recieved message: No the upgraded version lets you use more than 2 indicators at a time. With the free version you can only use 2 at a time.
2023-12-14 17:19:42 Recieved message: Hey guys, I just want some feedback from whoever uses Xenia and Aithena. I personally don’t use it but I’m signing up someone who wants to use it and I just want to know your journey/experience with it and how much you started with.
2023-12-14 17:23:33 Recieved message: Yeah my trade is still going. Well my 3. Have to let it ride for now. Can't back out. My fault for removing my sl. Learning experience
2023-12-14 17:30:42 Recieved message: As long as you have enough capital to cover the difference without your trades closing automatically , isn’t it possible that the market could move back in your favor and the trades can become profitable?
2023-12-14 17:42:31 Recieved message: Velkommen Amin 🔥
2023-12-14 17:56:42 Recieved message: 
2023-12-14 18:00:42 Recieved message: Oh man yeah, I know. I saw the spike in relation to entry! 😅🫶🏻 looks like it’s coming back down though. Wishing you all the best and I appreciate you breaking things down and sharing your experience along the way!
2023-12-14 18:01:42 Recieved message: Being transparent with losses can be hard. I’m going through the same thing right now. personally feeling like I’ll wait off December for how volatile it is . 
The stress has been too much

2023-12-14 18:38:44 Recieved message: Im holding
2023-12-14 18:40:43 Recieved message: Me too. I hope it's coming down at least 2017.87 to be on entry.
2023-12-14 18:44:43 Recieved message: 
2023-12-14 18:44:43 Recieved message: same. ill let it ride till then
2023-12-14 18:46:43 Recieved message: Yes stop loss, lot size and your own personal amount that you’re willing to not go beyond per trade are all your friend. I had a low lot size so that’s the only reason I took off SL but then also have that risk management number in your head where even with that advice, you won’t let the trade go beyond that $X that you’re willing to risk. All a learning curve and Ralph once said he blew three accounts when he first started because of all the learning curves 🤪 you are persistent and willing to learn Nic so you will make money in trading 🙌🏻 love your never give up attitude despite that experience 🫶🏼
2023-12-14 18:52:44 Recieved message: 
2023-12-14 19:09:44 Recieved message: ooooh gold is going down slowly but it's going down at the moment 🙌🏻
