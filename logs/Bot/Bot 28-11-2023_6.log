2023-11-28 06:32:50 Recieved message: Correct cause the M5/M15 timeframe is what scalpers use since they enter and exits trades quick, whereas the H4 timeframe is what day traders use cause they enter the trade and hold their positions longer.
2023-11-28 06:48:50 Recieved message: -erfect. Thx for the advice
2023-11-28 07:34:50 Recieved message: Yes v the shorter timeframe may be more for scalpers.   I trade can take 2-3 days to come through.    Don’t go be the time Frank

2023-11-28 07:45:16 Recieved message: What’s the difference between Metatrader 4 to Metatrader 5 and which one is the best option to use
2023-11-28 08:38:12 Recieved message: MT4 is for automatic trading that you can link eacho, MT5 is manual trading
2023-11-28 08:39:09 Recieved message: Thank you 🙏
2023-11-28 08:56:16 Recieved message: Metatrader 4 and 5 are very similar actually , 5 is just a bit more updated . You are more than welcome to manually trade with either or . Unless you have eacho like Sara metioned it’s recommended to use mt4 for EACHO and mt5 for manual trading .
2023-11-28 09:04:51 Recieved message: is there a way for me to switch teams or learn under someone else ?
2023-11-28 09:11:11 Recieved message: What is EACHO?
2023-11-28 09:13:00 Recieved message: Is that an additional package you can order?
2023-11-28 09:13:51 Recieved message: you want to change mentor?

2023-11-28 09:20:38 Recieved message: Thank you so much 💕
2023-11-28 09:20:38 Recieved message: correct, except what the timeframes indicate isnt how quickly to get into the trade, it means how much time one candle stick is worth
2023-11-28 09:20:53 Recieved message: Thank you so much 💕
2023-11-28 09:20:53 Recieved message: so on the M5 every candle represents 5 mins of price action whereas on the H1 every candle represents one hour of price action
2023-11-28 09:37:52 Recieved message: Guys , is the eca working for y’all? I can login myself normally in the eaconomy site and when I try to open eca for the backvideos it says my password is incorrect and when I try to change it , it says no account found under my email … which doesn’t make any sense at all because I can still login etc

2023-11-28 10:30:53 Recieved message: How do u know wht time frame a trade last or should last ?
2023-11-28 10:47:53 Recieved message: It’s called trade management you should risk no more than 5 percent on every trade so the bigger the stop loss they give out the smaller lot size you wanna use and honestly to be safe if you cash out after 10 -20 pips and don’t get greedy you will have more profit trade but you may miss out on a big move but it’s honestly way safer
2023-11-28 11:14:53 Recieved message: hey everyone i was just getting started with onboarding but none of the video links work for me. does anyone know why? or somewhere else i can access them? 🥲

I can't see the menu and the videos are disorganized
2023-11-28 12:01:51 Recieved message: I see all fine and organized.

Try close this window and go back to back office and reopen ECA again. That I do when I can't log-in and tell me email or password is wrong. Then when I reopen eca from back office all was fine.
2023-11-28 12:09:54 Recieved message: Hey, is anyone else having trouble accessing eca and the back office?
2023-11-28 12:11:54 Recieved message: I did, but it still doesn't work, are you using Google Chrome?

2023-11-28 13:04:54 Recieved message: same here, my live chat is closed right now, but I did send an email to support@eaconomy.com

2023-11-28 13:10:54 Recieved message: You mean go through the link or the Forex LTS ect?
2023-11-28 13:11:54 Recieved message: It depends what you plan to start with on a live account because you want to use an appropriate lot size in accordance to what you will start with on a live account
2023-11-28 13:12:54 Recieved message: But for 5000 that lot is to small
2023-11-28 13:12:54 Recieved message:

2023-11-28 13:14:54 Recieved message: Hmmm,then I don't know,I had problem yesterday aswell
2023-11-28 13:14:54 Recieved message: So for the $5000 demo account I should use a lot size of 1.0
2023-11-28 13:15:54 Recieved message: Oh, ok I didn't realise that the back office had changed aswell
2023-11-28 13:15:54 Recieved message: https://www.cashbackforex.com/tools/position-size-calculator/XAU.USD
2023-11-28 13:15:54 Recieved message: my backoffice looks the same, what I did was open the ECA from the back office
2023-11-28 13:16:51 Recieved message: But essentially it's 0.01 per $100
2023-11-28 13:18:54 Recieved message: Ok thanks
2023-11-28 13:18:54 Recieved message: Use a realistic lot size that u will use for live account so that u can see what profits you could potentially make on a live with that lot size
