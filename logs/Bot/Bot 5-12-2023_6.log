2023-12-05 12:51:13 Recieved message: I think you have to go back in and confirm that you want to keep receiving the telegram messages once a week, if I'm not mistaken.

2023-12-05 16:31:03 Recieved message: Anyone ever have an issue where your broker just made a bid disappear? I set it, I was in the middle of scalping another pair when it entered and hit TP and now it’s just gone as if I never put it in.
2023-12-05 16:34:16 Recieved message: In another group and others having the same problem.
2023-12-05 16:34:16 Recieved message: Yes.  It depends on the. Rocker and covering the spread.  If the spread is 112 and you only have 100 you can not trade it.  You need enough to cover and room for loss.
2023-12-05 16:34:16 Recieved message: What broker ?

Was it a pending order or was it executed?
2023-12-05 16:53:17 Recieved message: FinesseFX. Just moved to them this morning. It was a pending order and then executed. I literally watched it execute and then hit TP. And then when I went to the history it’s not there.
2023-12-05 16:55:17 Recieved message: Mt5?
2023-12-05 16:56:17 Recieved message: If so I've had that issue with a trade last night. It didn't show up til this morning due to the times are different
2023-12-05 16:56:17 Recieved message: But they all should show up
2023-12-05 16:58:17 Recieved message: Yep. No it didn’t register at all. The balance does not reflect it and every trade I took after is on there and reflected in the balance. They literally made my trade disappear.
2023-12-05 17:00:17 Recieved message: I was going to say the same thing. Having a demo account with 100k gives a false sense of security. You end up making trades with lot sizes that are unrealistic and when you create a live account with a few hundred, you can blow it on a single trade. I like the Finesse broker because it lets you deposit exactly how much you want to start with. Instead of choosing an exorbitant amount of money. It makes the demo account much more realistic and makes learning easier.
2023-12-05 17:06:17 Recieved message: When I was able to use a hanko trade demo it allowed me to have a realistic amount of 100 and would notify me when a lot size was way over my head
2023-12-05 17:06:17 Recieved message: That is super odd.
2023-12-05 17:07:17 Recieved message: What was the trade?
2023-12-05 17:09:17 Recieved message: GBPUSD
2023-12-05 17:10:17 Recieved message: I know there was news on USD but that shouldn't reflect your trade for disappearing. Maybe overleverage a trade?
2023-12-05 17:13:09 Recieved message: No. Again I literary watched it open and hit TP. I was sitting right in front of my computer when it happed. Asides from I don't over leverage and it was the only trade active at that moment.
2023-12-05 17:18:17 Recieved message: Can someone please explain what the swap is? I’ve tried looking it up but I just don’t understand. Sometimes I make money off of it and sometimes I lose money off of it. I don’t understand what it is or how it works.
2023-12-05 17:21:17 Recieved message: It's when you leave a trade running overnight. It's a fee the broker charges. Changes per pair/lot size.

2023-12-05 17:25:17 Recieved message: No way you’re making money on a swap.   Swap is a fee to over over from 1 session (day) to the next.   It’s a fee you’re paying
2023-12-05 17:26:17 Recieved message: 
2023-12-05 17:26:17 Recieved message: I made $4.63 on the swap
2023-12-05 17:29:17 Recieved message: You can see from the picture that it cancelled out my commission and I ended up with a 43 cent gain.
2023-12-05 17:34:17 Recieved message: That’s the 1st time I’m seeing that as a positive. All my swaps are negative 😂

2023-12-05 17:39:17 Recieved message: 
2023-12-05 17:39:29 Recieved message: I don’t know if that’s what I managed to do or not, like I said, I really don’t understand it. I just know that it happened.
2023-12-05 17:40:17 Recieved message: It happens if you bought/sell it while spread was better than it at the time of closing. It happened to me many times
2023-12-05 17:40:17 Recieved message: Spread was very small at the time you took the trade

2023-12-06 13:46:35 Recieved message: Me too
2023-12-06 13:47:35 Recieved message: Smtime does the complete opposite
2023-12-06 13:47:35 Recieved message: .09 is pretty high. I did a trade for gold at .1 And lost 160 only bc I didn't let it ride but it's pretty expensive if not using correct lot sizes.
2023-12-06 13:48:35 Recieved message: Yea I took a trade on gbpchf just to test it when my own analysis came out to sell on it and gbp jpy
2023-12-06 13:50:35 Recieved message: I kinda want to do the opposite at times. Lol
2023-12-06 13:51:35 Recieved message: If u do the opposite w a gr lot size  and get out quick u can make some money
2023-12-06 13:51:35 Recieved message: Risky tho
2023-12-06 13:54:33 Recieved message: Yea I rather just stick to a top down analysis
2023-12-06 13:54:33 Recieved message: No need to guess we want to live to trade another day
2023-12-06 13:56:33 Recieved message: Yes true. I wont do it just seem like every trade starts in the other direction and reaches my sl before i can make profit
2023-12-06 13:58:35 Recieved message: If it eventually goes the way you want have you considered moving your sl I mean it doesn’t have to follow what they have given I did that this morning on the u/cad signal
2023-12-06 13:58:35 Recieved message: It has nothing to do with the lot size. They closed my trade almost 10 PIPs after my SL. My SL was set at 2023. They closed my trade at 2032.35. I could put the lot size at .01 and it wouldn’t matter if my trade doesn’t close when it’s supposed to.
2023-12-06 14:00:35 Recieved message: Lot sizes depend on how much you make and lose. But you get that. Sorry to hear that you're having troubles.
2023-12-06 14:00:35 Recieved message: I hv to gv tht a try. Thought of tht just never done it
2023-12-06 14:01:35 Recieved message: I agree

2023-12-06 14:07:23 Recieved message: Velkommen!!
2023-12-06 14:08:35 Recieved message: So you have to remember that your trade is also like an order it can depend on when it was filled yes they should take you out where you have placed
2023-12-06 14:10:35 Recieved message: I’m not understanding what you’re trying to say.
2023-12-06 14:12:35 Recieved message: News
2023-12-06 14:12:35 Recieved message: This most likely happened bc of news. Your SL will be ignored if you trade during those times
2023-12-06 14:13:13 Recieved message: I highly doubt they will screw you over knowing many of us are switching over to them
2023-12-06 14:13:35 Recieved message: Since when? In over 2000 trades I have NEVER had a SL ignored.
2023-12-06 14:13:35 Recieved message: Since ever. It's very well known thing
2023-12-06 14:14:35 Recieved message: You risk your sl being ignored when trading during news. It's a risk you treasure
2023-12-06 14:14:35 Recieved message: It’s like going through a drive thru so you’re not the only person that wants McDonald’s so there’s a probably a million other people who have their SL set there so there might be a delay and like Briana confirmed delay could have been tied to news but idc what you trade you’re technically placing an order with a broker and they gave to fill that request
2023-12-06 14:15:35 Recieved message: I watched my sl jumped the one and ONLY time I traded during news.
2023-12-06 14:15:35 Recieved message: Again in over 2000 trades I have never had a SL ignored. Whether it was a swing trade, day trade or position.
2023-12-06 14:15:35 Recieved message: The news my guy. It happens to the best of us
2023-12-06 14:15:35 Recieved message: It wasn’t ignored it was filled
2023-12-06 14:16:07 Recieved message: It was closed 10 Pips after it was supposed to.
2023-12-06 14:16:07 Recieved message: It jumps over it. Not "ignored" per se. I guess that's the wrong word to use here
2023-12-06 14:16:35 Recieved message: My manara is not working
2023-12-06 14:16:35 Recieved message: That's my point

2023-12-06 14:19:35 Recieved message: Compare brokers
2023-12-06 14:19:35 Recieved message: Yeah that’s the point. I didn’t have this problem with my old broker.
2023-12-06 14:19:35 Recieved message: There goes your answer
2023-12-06 14:19:46 Recieved message: Velkommen
2023-12-06 14:20:36 Recieved message: Just compare brokers to see if you’re getting same results on trade
2023-12-06 14:21:36 Recieved message: Again that’s the point. I didn’t have this problem with my old broker. Which is why I asked if anyone else had this problem because I just moved to them yesterday.
2023-12-06 14:21:36 Recieved message: Sooo what are you going to do ?
2023-12-06 14:22:36 Recieved message: Still not working
2023-12-06 14:22:36 Recieved message: I’m just going to go back to my old broker. I already contacted support and they told me it shouldn’t have happened and opened a ticket. I wasn’t looking for a why this happened, I just wanted to know if anyone else had this issue.
2023-12-06 14:22:36 Recieved message: Ok glad they helped
2023-12-06 14:23:53 Recieved message: Velkommen ❤️

2023-12-06 14:41:43 Recieved message: Velkommen❤️
2023-12-06 14:48:36 Recieved message: I would try restarting your computer and contact support ofc
2023-12-06 14:59:36 Recieved message: True which is why they always recommend removing your SL during news or just not trading at all.
2023-12-06 15:03:36 Recieved message: It’s just strange that the “regulated” broker would do that. Kinda got me curious now as I do also have finesse.
2023-12-06 15:11:34 Recieved message: Removing your SL could blow your account during the news. And as far as not trading at all, I swing trade. It’s impossible for my trades not to run through the news.
2023-12-06 15:23:36 Recieved message: Have you asked them to compensate
2023-12-06 15:24:47 Recieved message: Velkommen❤️
2023-12-06 15:39:33 Recieved message: Waiting to hear back from them
2023-12-06 15:40:37 Recieved message: They should do
2023-12-06 15:43:13 Recieved message: It can blow your account which is why they only recommend those do it that can sit there and monitor it during news. Hope you get back your funds man.
2023-12-06 15:50:37 Recieved message: I have had it happen before where my SL or even a TP was missed….espically with a fast moving pair or gold.   If news comes out and it rips it can tend to miss.  Happened with Oanda, HugosWay and Masari over the years.  It’s rare and I don’t think I ever had 10 pips but has happened.  Again noticed it happened with news and spreads
2023-12-06 15:52:37 Recieved message: Not yet, where are those located please?
2023-12-06 15:52:37 Recieved message: Yes, ok. Thank you

2023-12-06 16:06:37 Recieved message: Buy/sell zones and RSI cross.   Of all the Manera signals that come, I found maybe 1 in 30 are some what valid and it could be more than a week before an okay signal came over.   Of the okay signals maybe 1/2 had any profits and of the profitable ones maybe 2 or 3 would barley hit TP1
2023-12-06 16:07:37 Recieved message: Thank you Shawn, I’ll test zones and rsi 😊
2023-12-06 16:08:37 Recieved message: Ralph will show the buy/sell zones with an MA cross or something.   Others have talked about an RSI cross.  You need to look at several and decide what works for you.
2023-12-06 16:09:33 Recieved message: When you see them in reviewing charts they are pretty obvious however in real time they can be tricky to pick up

2023-12-06 18:32:40 Recieved message: The chats will however ALWAYS be talking about xauusd
2023-12-06 18:33:40 Recieved message: Interesting. Why is that? Does no one trade the other pairs?
2023-12-06 18:34:40 Recieved message: Speaking strictly expert chats and gold,  no. They always refer to xauusd.
2023-12-06 18:34:40 Recieved message: I couldn't tell you why. I've been here since Nov and it's always that

If you are trying to personally message Leona, she is currently traveling right now so she might not be able to message you back ASAP. 

She will however get back to messages as soon as she is back home 🙌🏾

Please be patient ! 

Janae, Leona’s Assistant
2023-12-06 19:48:52 Recieved message: Velkommen
2023-12-06 19:54:41 Recieved message: Yes same here. Apparently this week the market is a bit volatile because of the USA unemployment rate coming out on Friday (NFP), so a little chart analysis is needed before taking any manara alerts and do small lot sizes if you do
2023-12-07 09:10:24 Recieved message: close +10pips
2023-12-07 09:10:24 Recieved message: +20pips close some profits
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: anybody know why ive made more than 2€ in my one trade and its only saying ive made less than the two add up?
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: maybe swap?
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: what am i swapping?
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: press on the trade for details
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: there it should show you swap charges
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: what are the swap charges that’s exactly what it is but what does that mean?
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: i cant explain it exactly but it has to do with spreads
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: like if spreads were lower when you entered the trade than now i think they charge you more
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: something like that
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: fair confusing
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: and the other way around too, if spreads were wider in the beginning than now you get extra swap
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: find that so weird
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: yes i dont fully understand it either, but i bet you can find out a lot about it if you google or ask chatgpt
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: ive been trading around a month and only finding out about it now😂
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: yeah i think thats normal, took me about that time aswell
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: It’s been over 24 hours, mt4/5 is still isn’t pulling the hankotrade and herofx broker on the app
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: This has been going on for a week now if you have a demo account setup already it will still work! Just be patient they are working through the issue I know that it sucks but it will all work out
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: 
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: UPDATE ON METATRADER 4 & 5 ISSUES ‼️
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: TEAM PLEASE BE READING THIS CHAT FOR UPDATES ‼️ 

If you personally message me for certain things, I know you did not read this chat! This is what the chat is created for. So please PIN this chat in your telegram so you never miss an update !

We are only in control of so many things. This issue with the broker WILL PASS. Just be patient please 🙏🏾 This is a minor setback for a major comeback. Once MT4/MT5 and Hankotrade fix this issue, we will then be able to trade again 🤞🏾 

I appreciate everyone who is being extremely patient as we are currently working on this. 

We will be updating everyone here on a daily basis on the status of MT4.

2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: Chart analysis is need for EVERY trade.  Even if it’s just to look to see if it’s an up trend or down
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: I see trades on Manara that say buy but are actually caught in sell. Almost did one and saw it was in entry, got all excited then saw it was in sell but manara says a buy. glad im watching ralph
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: 🫶🏻🤍
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: Found that happening ALOT.  So much that out of 30 alerts maybe 2-3 were worth additional follow up and maybe 1 might have been worth taking.  This was over the course of about 2 weeks.     Thankful for the Manera, but it’s tough to spend the money on the program with no results ya know
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: Think of it this way, the monthly subscription you’re spending is also getting you access to learn from the best like Ralph and trade for long term growth ☺️ Then you’ll get more confidence using the manara trades too. Still a good investment on the bright side ☺️
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: Quick question

It close just now at 5:28
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: The only market open now is Sydney which may be why?. I use this website to help me determine market hours and timezones which Ralph recommended as well in a training sesh: forex.timezoneconverter.com
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: Anyone got update on manara?
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: /
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: I have not been receiving signals and this is the way manara opens in my browsers. Tried 4 different pc, ipad and iphone
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: Used chrome browser and safari. Nothing
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: Strange mine doing the same too
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: Been like this since sunday
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: Weird very
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: Try clicking monitor under this 3 lines. Mine looks the same
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: Are you near resubscription?
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: Mine is working ok, are you accessing it via the Eaconomy website?
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: I just retried again on another desktop and its working
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: Just need to wait now and see if i get signals
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: I reconnected the telegram bot
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: My manara is doing the same things and had been like that for a while
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: Click on notifications to refresh it as well.
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: Not yet

2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: 
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: I was clicking notifications so I can get them from manara and my notifications still won’t pop up
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: Let your mentor know as well. They may know if there’s an update. If you’ve closed it and gone through Eaconomy to access it again, that may help otherwise definitely let your mentor or Eaconomy know 🌻
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: Welcome to the fam!! 🥳
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: Oh I’m aware but it also as to be sustainable too
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: Thank you for the information I will do that
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: What are you struggling to see results with?
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: Not struggling.   Just pointing out how many “bad” trades Manera was putting out and following a trade plan.   Hard to hit that 2% a day when the signals are junk
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: And nothing worth taking comes for days or weeks
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: The signals aren’t junk, it’s just about knowing which ones to take. Not all of Manara’s trades are going to win but what has helped me is watching Ralph’s recordings which is under ‘forex and Manara training’. He explains really well which Manara trades look good to take and other basics about Manara. Definitely suggest looking into it 😊
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: I’m well aware of this.  I’m not new.  I have and do follow Ralph’s lessons and that’s why the trades seem junky.  Manera will send a buy in Ralph’s sell zone or inside the RSI without a cross.   There was a stretch of 24 trades where not a single one fell within the rules.  Another time was nearly 2 weeks before a reasonable trade came out.
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: How i win with manara is pickup up potentials on 1h and 4h timesframe and scaling down to smaller timeframe following big scale trend directions
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: Markout major support and resitance and take trades on smaller timeframes following manara signal
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: Try nos to take reversals.
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: Wait for retets
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: Retest
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: It's not just copy and past. Use manara as an add on and not blind
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: That is how i see it
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: 
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: For gold example, if i get a bearish signal on 4h timeframe i take it with extra SL
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: Everyone help me welcome my girl Emily, she’s super passionate about starting and I can’t wait to see how far she goes. Let’s kill some goals girl❤️‍🔥🥂

2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: For Ralphs Channel, when his alerts come in are those trades, day trade or swing trade alerts?
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: Same with Ploutos Channel?
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: I think it depends on the trade and the chart he is looking at at the time.   I know when I was with him for a few weeks there was only 1 trade alerted (by another member) that was taken and profitable
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: Ok. Thank you
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: Hey guys how are y’all trading ? The desktop version is not letting me log in I feel like I’m missing money 😩

2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: Can someone send me a trade to enter?
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: hi oshane, if you are looking to enter a trade, please do not demand it here on this chat, either kindly wait for the experts to send one, or go to manara, or simply do your own analysis. if you are needing help, feel free to reach out💙
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: Sorry, Your trade signals should be on manara if you aren’t getting it to put it in your database.
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Recieved message: I thought it was my problem only?? It’s been like this for 2 weeks and i thought it was resub problem but … it’s still not working
