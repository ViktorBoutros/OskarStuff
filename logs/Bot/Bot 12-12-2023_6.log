2023-12-12 15:09:25 Recieved message: Yes it’s based on your broker
2023-12-12 15:12:25 Recieved message: Ploutos has been around longer than Eacho.   I personally don’t see Eacho working too well.  Doesn’t seem like folks are having any success with it.   

As for Ploutos, I find it faster but trades are not really explained.  It is often hard to keep up and understand.   It also needs an account that is well funded

If folks are having a hard time getting the broker accounts set up or a hard time figuring out Manera, I would HIGHLY recommend staying away from both Plutos and Eacho.   Learn how to get your account set up and where to find training first
2023-12-12 15:13:25 Recieved message: Who is your broker and what are you trying to add ?
2023-12-12 15:14:25 Recieved message: I use cash app to buy the Bitcoin and then transfer it to my Finesse wallet.   Once cleared I move it from my wallet to my account(s)
2023-12-12 15:15:55 Recieved message: Same with mine
2023-12-12 15:17:25 Recieved message: To show anyone can really do this.   I tossed $10 into an account yesterday and made a couple trades.     Focused on 2 pairs.   This was in 2 days time.
2023-12-12 15:19:25 Recieved message: This was a live account.    I would NOT recommend doing this for newer folks but is posted to show you don’t need $1000s or to learn 5-10 pairs and bounce around.   

$10…..2 pairs….2 days…..

2023-12-12 15:39:26 Recieved message: Yes and nothing happens
2023-12-12 15:41:26 Recieved message: What are your Manera settings.    Like if you only have a couple pairs on a 1 or 4 hr, with specific patterns there may not be any alerts
2023-12-12 15:41:26 Recieved message: When did you get the bot set up ?
2023-12-12 15:41:26 Recieved message: Try this video. I made this. See if it helps
2023-12-12 15:42:26 Recieved message: Got it done yesterday
2023-12-12 15:43:26 Recieved message: Ok.  It’s possible there have not been any based on your settings
2023-12-12 16:00:26 Recieved message: Anyone have tips on how to know when to close a sale ? I know the stop loss will do it for you however yesterday I was profiting about$100 but it ended up going back down to like  $12 because I didn’t close in time I guess so I regretting not closing the sale .
2023-12-12 16:02:26 Recieved message: Set your tp and it close out in profit
2023-12-12 16:04:26 Recieved message: What happened when you closed out, did it hit your tp?
2023-12-12 16:07:26 Recieved message: I am putting the stop loss and take profit from the very beginning however, I guess it never hit take profit or stop loss
2023-12-12 16:09:26 Recieved message: But there was opportunity for profit the price was profitable at one point so I guess I feel like I should’ve took it ? Or is it just a waiting game should I just have held ?
2023-12-12 16:10:26 Recieved message: Taking the alerts from the experts or your own analysis?
2023-12-12 16:11:26 Recieved message: I would suggest, next time you're in profit 100 get out and live to trade another day. Money will come. Trust me. Patience is key in this game.
2023-12-12 16:12:26 Recieved message: This was on the gold sale yesterday from experts the XAU one If I remember correctly
2023-12-12 16:12:26 Recieved message: Normally I'd hold onto what the experts say and let it ride out because the market does up and down.
2023-12-12 16:12:26 Recieved message: I was waiting for a message to advise to sell but it didn’t come so I just sold 😩 next time I’ll hold
2023-12-12 16:14:26 Recieved message: Yes go in for the sell right away then go to your trade and click on it then modify it to put your sl n tp in. You hit the sell button when they say to do then modify your trade to enter sl n tp they recommend.
2023-12-12 16:14:26 Recieved message: Yeah. Wait for the message for gold. You in ploutos channel?
2023-12-12 16:15:26 Recieved message: I don’t believe I am on ploutos channel
2023-12-12 16:15:26 Recieved message: Got it thank you 😩
2023-12-12 16:17:26 Recieved message: Ploutos you have to pay 25 a month but worth it bc he is the gold Guru for alerts. He's having a great month so far. With manara trades ideas & sessions, they don't come out as quick as pluotos but they are consistent. I trust ploutos more for gold
2023-12-12 16:19:26 Recieved message: Oh okay yes I will be sure to invest in that is there a link you can share please?
2023-12-12 16:20:26 Recieved message: I have taken gold and other trades with manaras alerts. They came out with profits.
2023-12-12 16:22:26 Recieved message: Go into your backoffice, then go to orders then place an order. Then find ploutos channel. Then purchase
2023-12-12 16:22:26 Recieved message: I’ll have do more research to learn which trades are gold I’m still learning 😭
2023-12-12 16:23:26 Recieved message: Xauusd is gold
2023-12-12 16:25:26 Recieved message: It takes time. Don't rush it. I only take the experts alerts because I haven't learned enough about trading to do my own. I'll be on a demo for that until I'm comfortable doing it on my own
2023-12-12 16:27:27 Recieved message: Same here I’ll be more patient moving forward 🫨🥰
2023-12-12 16:49:26 Recieved message: Is there a video on how to set up echo if we do have one where can I access it?
2023-12-12 16:50:27 Recieved message: I used the video to set the manara system and no difference not sure what else to do
2023-12-12 16:59:27 Recieved message: Contact support
2023-12-12 17:02:27 Recieved message: This is all part of the training and experience.   Learn candles, support & resistance and stuff.   Trades do not always hit TP.   Mike your SL to stay in profit if you want.   There is no real end all, be all answer.    

Alittle of something is better than a lot of nothing.  

You were up $100.   How big is your account ?    Up $100 on a $500 or $1000 account is huge.   $100 on a $100,000 account is nothing

2023-12-12 18:00:28 Recieved message: Right but he said he used it when asked. How good or efficient it works? That remains to be seen.

2023-12-13 03:09:27 Recieved message: It’s not yet. They’re integrating it into the eacho dashboard
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Recieved message: Thank you for the update
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Recieved message: I can only withdraw my profits in bitcoin, does anyone recommend an app to send it to which has low fees for withdrawing bitcoin?
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Recieved message: This is where having a trading plan can really help and guide you. I am currently on a small trading plan where I’m aiming to make $20 a day and I’m happy to risk $5 in stop loss to make $20. If one trade hits $20 even if it’s still going up I’ll close out and I’m done for the day. As you hit your trading plan goals you can start to increase your goals. There’s a great training in the ECA that Ralph does about trading plans and risk management to help guide you 🙏🏻 All the training to understand trades, Manara, candles, trends etc are all set up in ECA. I’ve found them to be really helpful ☺️
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Recieved message: Great logic I’m writing these things down so I can make a plan for myself as well thank you 😌
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Recieved message: This.  All of this
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Recieved message: I use Cashapp.   I will also make deposits/withdrawals by following BTC.  When BTC is up I’ll withdraw.   When it’s down I’ll buy
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Recieved message: Does it make a significant difference if you transfer it to your personal bank immediately after?
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Recieved message: For me no as I tx cash back and forth.
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Recieved message: I don’t wait or even set SL for these.  I get into profit and move my SL so it’s basically risk free trade.   The account is only $10 so at $0.50 profit is 5% 

10 $0.50 wins is $5 and. Do that for 2 days an I doubled my account 

It’s repetitive so if my account is $100 I can nearly double it in 2-3 days
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Recieved message: Had anyone ever tried depositing with vantage and gets this error message ?

2023-12-13 03:09:27 Recieved message: Best it to look at it and analysis it when you see it.   Sometimes it’s good for mins….sometime hours
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Recieved message: good evening, i was wondering if someone could help me cancel my subscription? i love what this organization does but i personally haven’t learned much more than i already know abt trading and i didn’t realize that this was a subscription type deal :/
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Recieved message: Yes just need a disclaimer on the post to!
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Recieved message: I guess just don’t renew your subscription autoship date. Maybe gotta block it from auto processing from your bank or just contact support.

2023-12-13 03:09:27 Recieved message: Today, I’m having to remind myself that results are just about being in the right position at the right time. Its an objective game and I can’t let my feelings get in the way. Just do everything in my power to be  smart and calculated, and take what comes from there as continue learning opportunities. 🫡
