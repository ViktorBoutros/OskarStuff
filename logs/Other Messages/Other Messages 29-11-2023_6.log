2023-11-29 10:32:56 As usual ,make sure to move SL to entry after 30-40pips and close 20% to 30%
2023-11-29 11:02:23 How can my cousin join if he’s only 16 in Europe?
2023-11-29 11:02:40 Sooo good
2023-11-29 11:16:49 Welcome Jerry
2023-11-29 11:40:56 Girl me too! So I apologize in advance if I ask a lot of questions! 😅
2023-11-29 11:41:56 You and me both! Lol
2023-11-29 13:12:58 Can someone tell me if I make good analysis on XAG/USD:
https://www.tradingview.com/x/ajcF7Zx7/

Entry is: 24.750 - 24.650
SL: 24.950
TP1: 24.250
TP2: 23.750

I still figure out how to find good entry. Any help will welcome.
2023-11-29 13:17:58 Is this a sell
2023-11-29 13:23:13 Are people still in the gold?
2023-11-29 13:31:58 Guys , do y’all have access to the eca?
2023-11-29 13:32:23 Trying to login myself but it’s not working
2023-11-29 13:32:58 we logged in yesterday and we got trough
2023-11-29 13:33:58 saw all new vids
2023-11-29 13:33:58 Same here , but now it’s not working again
2023-11-29 13:33:58 ah ok we did logged in this morning let me check
2023-11-29 13:33:58 Yes,it's sell.

I still try to figure out to find good entry, so I'm asking for opinion.
2023-11-29 13:33:58 Thank you ☺️
2023-11-29 13:36:58 i got trough but is very slow though
2023-11-29 13:36:58 uploading vids is veeeerrrrry slow
2023-11-29 13:36:58 but i got trough
2023-11-29 13:37:58 Yes I had the same problem I can access with very slow uploading the backoffice but not eca.. and when I try to set my password it says no account found 😅
2023-11-29 13:37:58 Thank you tho, appreciate it!xx
2023-11-29 13:37:58 ow i entered eca as well
2023-11-29 13:44:58 Oh okay . That’s weird … I’ll wait a bit and otherwise I’ll text support
2023-11-29 13:47:23 try logging out and logging in after a while
2023-11-29 13:50:58 Does anyone know if you have to set up a free trial on Trading  view. To use the indicators.
2023-11-29 13:58:58 no just open and use it💁‍♀️
2023-11-29 14:00:58 👍. Everytime I try to use the “wave trend with crosses [lazy bear]” indicator. It what’s me to update the account to access it.
2023-11-29 14:00:59 you need to remove some of the one you have open. you can only have 2 at a time
2023-11-29 14:01:58 Oh okay that’s probably the issue. Thank you
2023-11-29 14:02:23 Yup that was it🫡
2023-11-29 14:16:59 Same, are you also not able to watch Ralph’s training vids? I only seen 3 of them and don’t know which date they are or anything.
2023-11-29 14:17:59 I can’t even enter the e-card … just saw it yesterday quick , they changed everything and that’s it
2023-11-29 14:17:59 I was having the same issue.
2023-11-29 14:18:22 Is anyone else having trouble entering their TradeLocker account?
2023-11-29 14:21:59 For those trading us30, do you use mt4 or mt5?
2023-11-29 14:21:59 Mt4
2023-11-29 14:23:59 Yeah it looks completely different.
2023-11-29 14:24:54 Does anyone’s mt4,5 say instant execution. Rather than market execution like everyone else.
2023-11-29 14:24:59 At least you have access 😅
2023-11-29 14:25:59 I did before but now I don’t, spoke too soon 😂
2023-11-29 14:25:59 😂😂😂 … let’s hope we’ll be able to access soon
2023-11-29 14:26:59 Mines say market execution
2023-11-29 14:26:59 Mine does but I use mt5
2023-11-29 14:28:59 MT4 mobile don’t even work for most anymore. It’s becoming outdated
2023-11-29 14:28:59 Feel like I’m the only one that’s says instant execution. Everyone else has market. 🤔 does it make a difference
2023-11-29 14:28:59 Yea  I’m using mT5
2023-11-29 14:28:59 But even on my mt4 it says instant instead of market.
2023-11-29 14:28:59 Not me trading 5
2023-11-29 14:29:59 I don’t think I ever seen instant execution before 🤔
2023-11-29 14:29:59 Dang that’s weird
2023-11-29 14:29:59 Hmmm hopefully someone with more experience can answer that.
2023-11-29 14:30:59 It may not make a difference but you never know.
2023-11-29 14:31:59 Yea hopefully.
2023-11-29 14:33:59 https://justmarkets.com/trading/market-execution#:~:text=At%20Instant%20Execution%2C%20the%20broker,without%20confirmation%20of%20the%20trader.
2023-11-29 14:33:59 Maybe there is something with ur broker?
2023-11-29 14:37:00 So after reading there is a slight difference. Maybe it could be I don’t have a broker in mt5 yet I’m still using the mt5 demo
2023-11-29 14:37:59 
2023-11-29 14:37:59 Nvm it makes a big difference
2023-11-29 14:39:54 Ah maybe why than because of its a demo acc i had that also but now i am trading live
2023-11-29 14:40:59 Ahh okay
2023-11-29 14:41:59 Anyone who is currently using Masari … how are you working your live account ? I cannot add Masari as a broker to MT4 Mobile or MT4 Web .
2023-11-29 14:45:59 Try MT5
2023-11-29 14:48:59 I tried too but broker doesn’t show. Look into Nash markets with tradelocker 🙏🏽
2023-11-29 14:48:59 Just tried again on MT5 and Masari doesn’t come up yet. I don’t think they transferred over yet .
2023-11-29 14:48:59 Thank you ! 🙏🏼
2023-11-29 14:57:59 These are links to more of Ralph’s videos. They still don’t have the more recent videos uploaded yet
2023-11-29 15:02:03 Someone?
2023-11-29 15:09:43 yes
2023-11-29 15:14:28 i hit stoploss on gold
2023-11-29 15:14:41 might wait to it to hit the top again and go into it again
2023-11-29 15:21:33 Any update on Eacho and Hanko?
2023-11-29 15:32:59 just realised my mistake with the gold, my stoploss was set to 2043 and not 2052🥲😭😭
2023-11-29 16:09:00 I can’t even get that far lol
2023-11-29 16:18:00 Goodmorning . I am trying to access the linkintree and it's giving this error
2023-11-29 16:19:00 
2023-11-29 16:21:00 Hey hey does somebody know if there is a French group here?
2023-11-29 16:24:00 Hey everyone welcome Edilson to the fam❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥

2023-11-29 17:00:12 Hvilken lotsize calculator bruker folk her?
2023-11-29 17:00:48 Jeg bruker denne

2023-11-29 17:02:04 takker bro
2023-11-29 17:04:01 Question: Will a trade ever close on its own or will it keep running indefinitely until it either hits T/P or S/L or if its manually closed?
2023-11-29 17:05:01 a trade never closes on its own until you close it
2023-11-29 17:05:01 or hit st
2023-11-29 17:06:01 Awesome! Thank you!
2023-11-29 17:06:01 So for a t/p we’ll have to close manually
2023-11-29 17:06:01 Yes or no
2023-11-29 17:06:16 Mine have always closed automatically once T/P is hit
2023-11-29 17:09:01 Tp closes automatically just like sl…you can close manually though before it hits tp or sl
2023-11-29 17:09:55 If you want the trade to run to T/P2, 3.. ect., then you have to modify the trade and change the T/P limit before it hits and closes correct?
2023-11-29 17:16:02 Yes that’s correct
2023-11-29 17:16:02 Thanks Hannah
2023-11-29 17:16:02 Sometimes people take multiple trades with different take profits for this reason, so that they don’t have to modify in the future.
2023-11-29 17:16:16 But that’s risky if the trade goes the other way right?
2023-11-29 17:18:01 Yes it definitely can be. Proper risk management has to be accounted for very well.
2023-11-29 17:19:01 Gotcha!
2023-11-29 17:35:50 anyone still in the gold trade?
2023-11-29 17:40:57 Jupp

2023-11-29 18:21:02 Everyone please help me welcome Princess! Super excited to get started working with you ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
2023-11-29 18:21:39 welcome!!
2023-11-29 18:22:02 Mostly welcome!!!
2023-11-29 18:36:48 GOOD MORNING FAMILY 🌞 and happy Wednesday!

I am also holding the GOLD SELL as well lol let’s be patient and trust the trade 🙌🏾

I hope everyone is doing AMAZING today! Does anyone have any results to share? Whether it be demo or live accounts?
2023-11-29 18:37:21 We want to see everyone’s progress 🙌🏾
2023-11-29 18:38:15 i was at 110 positive and then it closed due to stoploss that i input wrongly and then i went back into it and currently at a minus waiting for the trade
2023-11-29 18:38:27 waiting for the trade to hit take profit
2023-11-29 18:40:16 it’s important to secure partials when you’re in profit and move SL to entry to BE
2023-11-29 18:40:24 aka break even 🙌🏾
2023-11-29 18:41:03 Welcome to the team Princess. 🤗
2023-11-29 18:42:01 Så gøy! Hvor er det?
2023-11-29 18:51:05 This was mine yesterday
2023-11-29 18:51:13 My first 💕
2023-11-29 18:53:03 Welcome!!!
2023-11-29 18:53:03 I LOVE IT.
2023-11-29 18:53:08 is this your live account
2023-11-29 18:53:54 Yes
2023-11-29 18:54:16 I took advantage of the bonus Hanko offered so that’s the credit. They matched my deposit.
2023-11-29 18:54:36 Also, just keep in mind for future purposes 🙌🏾 your lot size is way too high for account balance

If your account size is $200+ your max lot size is supposed to be 0.02 to manage risk properly 🙏🏾
2023-11-29 18:55:15 Ok thank you 🙏🏾
2023-11-29 18:57:03 Welcome!!

2023-11-29 20:15:31 
2023-11-29 20:19:14 Okay, sounds good! When you mean integrated - do we still have to log into eacho ai dashboard and add our metatrader with hankotrade? Just needed clarification.  Thanks!
2023-11-29 20:37:08 
2023-11-29 20:38:16 YAY!
2023-11-29 20:40:12 I did get an email couple hours ago regarding the implementation of eacho. Please definitely update us on when we will be able to view it on eacho ai dashboard when it becomes live so I can add MT4! 🙏
2023-11-29 20:41:19 Need help! I’m trying to link up Hankotrade to Meta Trader 4. So I can start my demo account. Any instructions any body?
2023-11-29 21:00:05 Welcome!!!
2023-11-29 21:04:05 There is. One vision : francophone
2023-11-29 21:15:52 I got them from the linktree step 9
2023-11-29 21:27:02 what price did the signal of gold SELL trade start in 1V empire trades? around 2038?
2023-11-29 21:33:19 2043 was the entry price
2023-11-29 21:33:27 I got it thanks
2023-11-29 21:34:05 Xauusd, 5 min chart... Anyone else seeing the head and shoulders?
You think we are going to have a downhill slope or is gold too resilient to let that happen?
2023-11-29 21:36:05 What is the percentage that a broker takes?
2023-11-29 22:13:43 is the gold market closed? or is it just not moving for me at all?
2023-11-29 22:20:14 I think it’s not moving
2023-11-29 22:20:24 The market is closed
2023-11-29 22:20:42 But you will see movement again in a couple of hours
2023-11-29 22:20:48 Ooh okay
2023-11-29 22:20:50 The session is closed it will reopen soon
2023-11-29 22:27:45 i see hankotrade on eacho now
2023-11-29 22:28:07 YASSSS FINALLY
2023-11-29 22:28:15 everyone connect Eacho 2
2023-11-29 22:28:26 I’ve heard good things about Eacho 1 and 2
2023-11-29 22:28:45 MetaTrader 4 or 5?
2023-11-29 22:32:05 4. It only gives the option MT4 for me. MT5 is for live manual trading
2023-11-29 22:33:33 Also, what is the recommended that we input for "maximum trades" and "equity protector %"
2023-11-29 22:43:04 Same just wondering if I did it right
