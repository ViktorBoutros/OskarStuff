2023-12-12 06:42:19 I’m from Australia. Coinspot and crypto.com work
2023-12-12 06:47:19 hmmm, coinzoom won't let me withdraw funds for another 90 days....just a word of warning to anyone else using coinzoom! was only $97usd so lucky it wasn't heaps more than that!
2023-12-12 06:58:19 thanks Talisse...i have coinspot also but haven't funded it yet.  All i want to do is get bitcoin so I can transfer it to finesse fx as they don't accept regular money. they don't make it easy lol

2023-12-12 11:50:49 Hi ladies, can’t seem to find the option for eminus and manara telegram accounts in the office. Got kicked again lol. From what i remember, it’s just under “tools”. 😄

2023-12-12 12:11:13 Welcome!!
2023-12-12 12:16:23 Hey how do we add funds to our live account? Like where do we get the bitcoin to transfer to the live acct which I believe is finesse fix that I’m using? Sorry I’m new and a little loss
2023-12-12 12:51:23 You can get the bitcoin by purchasing it through your cash app, Coinbase, etc….whatever platform you use and then transfer it from there to your finesse wallet
2023-12-12 13:05:24 In my live account, I am only seeing bitcoin pairs. It's not allowing me to add forex currency pairs in mt5. Anyone knows why?

2023-12-12 13:33:20 Thanks Nic I was scared to use cash app at first
2023-12-12 13:33:20 You're welcome
2023-12-12 13:33:51 Velkommen🎉
2023-12-12 13:34:24 Nic do you use pluotos
2023-12-12 13:37:24 Yes. Just got in on a good trade he just sent out
2023-12-12 13:39:24 Ok I was trying to see if I should do pluotus or eacho or both
2023-12-12 13:40:24 I don't know anything about eacho but plouts is good. He's been having a solid month so far. Worth it to me
2023-12-12 13:47:03 +70 ✅
2023-12-12 14:03:39 Not been happy with Eacho so far. Still have it on a Demo on Eacho 2. I think I might try Poltus and stop Eacho until it gets better.
2023-12-12 14:05:24 I was never able to connect and use it so i stoped Eacho and got on ploutos👍 happy so far
2023-12-12 14:16:25 I also stoped Eacho. I hope later it will get better succes
2023-12-12 14:19:25 Is Manara not launching for anyone else? I’ve been trying all morning, is it just a problem on my end?
2023-12-12 14:20:25 Some of the symbols are not in my MT5 , is it because I’m using vantage as my broker? I’m in Jamaica
2023-12-12 14:23:33 ManaraFX its not working? Or is just me
2023-12-12 14:36:47 TP1 +100 ✅
2023-12-12 14:41:25 This is why I'm glad I'm in this community! Done for today!
2023-12-12 14:47:47 Try logging out completely closing out and giving it a a second then go back in

Letttssss goooo!!!! 🙌🙌
2023-12-12 15:08:22 LOVE THIS!!! ♥️🏆
2023-12-12 15:09:25 Yes it’s based on your broker
2023-12-12 15:12:25 Ploutos has been around longer than Eacho.   I personally don’t see Eacho working too well.  Doesn’t seem like folks are having any success with it.   

As for Ploutos, I find it faster but trades are not really explained.  It is often hard to keep up and understand.   It also needs an account that is well funded

If folks are having a hard time getting the broker accounts set up or a hard time figuring out Manera, I would HIGHLY recommend staying away from both Plutos and Eacho.   Learn how to get your account set up and where to find training first
2023-12-12 15:13:25 Who is your broker and what are you trying to add ?
2023-12-12 15:14:25 I use cash app to buy the Bitcoin and then transfer it to my Finesse wallet.   Once cleared I move it from my wallet to my account(s)
2023-12-12 15:15:55 Same with mine
2023-12-12 15:17:25 To show anyone can really do this.   I tossed $10 into an account yesterday and made a couple trades.     Focused on 2 pairs.   This was in 2 days time.
2023-12-12 15:19:25 This was a live account.    I would NOT recommend doing this for newer folks but is posted to show you don’t need $1000s or to learn 5-10 pairs and bounce around.   

$10…..2 pairs….2 days…..
2023-12-12 15:26:25 I am new and my manara is not sending out signals to my telegram can I get some advice on how to have it working.
2023-12-12 15:27:25 Have you gone into the group and triggered the alert bot with your email and pin ?
2023-12-12 15:33:01 In my mt5, it’s not showing dollar amount only btc.  How can I change that
2023-12-12 15:33:27 You have to open a usd live account
2023-12-12 15:36:55 Same with mine
2023-12-12 15:38:34 If your MANARA FX isn’t working pls follow these steps! I do apologize for any inconvenience .
2023-12-12 15:39:26 Yes and nothing happens
2023-12-12 15:41:26 What are your Manera settings.    Like if you only have a couple pairs on a 1 or 4 hr, with specific patterns there may not be any alerts
2023-12-12 15:41:26 When did you get the bot set up ?
2023-12-12 15:41:26 Try this video. I made this. See if it helps
2023-12-12 15:42:26 Got it done yesterday
2023-12-12 15:43:26 Ok.  It’s possible there have not been any based on your settings
2023-12-12 16:00:26 Anyone have tips on how to know when to close a sale ? I know the stop loss will do it for you however yesterday I was profiting about$100 but it ended up going back down to like  $12 because I didn’t close in time I guess so I regretting not closing the sale .
2023-12-12 16:02:26 Set your tp and it close out in profit
2023-12-12 16:04:26 What happened when you closed out, did it hit your tp?
2023-12-12 16:07:26 I am putting the stop loss and take profit from the very beginning however, I guess it never hit take profit or stop loss
2023-12-12 16:09:26 But there was opportunity for profit the price was profitable at one point so I guess I feel like I should’ve took it ? Or is it just a waiting game should I just have held ?
2023-12-12 16:10:26 Taking the alerts from the experts or your own analysis?
2023-12-12 16:11:26 I would suggest, next time you're in profit 100 get out and live to trade another day. Money will come. Trust me. Patience is key in this game.
2023-12-12 16:12:26 This was on the gold sale yesterday from experts the XAU one If I remember correctly
2023-12-12 16:12:26 Normally I'd hold onto what the experts say and let it ride out because the market does up and down.
2023-12-12 16:12:26 I was waiting for a message to advise to sell but it didn’t come so I just sold 😩 next time I’ll hold
2023-12-12 16:14:26 Yes go in for the sell right away then go to your trade and click on it then modify it to put your sl n tp in. You hit the sell button when they say to do then modify your trade to enter sl n tp they recommend.
2023-12-12 16:14:26 Yeah. Wait for the message for gold. You in ploutos channel?
2023-12-12 16:15:26 I don’t believe I am on ploutos channel
2023-12-12 16:15:26 Got it thank you 😩
2023-12-12 16:17:26 Ploutos you have to pay 25 a month but worth it bc he is the gold Guru for alerts. He's having a great month so far. With manara trades ideas & sessions, they don't come out as quick as pluotos but they are consistent. I trust ploutos more for gold
2023-12-12 16:19:26 Oh okay yes I will be sure to invest in that is there a link you can share please?
2023-12-12 16:20:26 I have taken gold and other trades with manaras alerts. They came out with profits.
2023-12-12 16:22:26 Go into your backoffice, then go to orders then place an order. Then find ploutos channel. Then purchase
2023-12-12 16:22:26 I’ll have do more research to learn which trades are gold I’m still learning 😭
2023-12-12 16:23:26 Xauusd is gold
2023-12-12 16:25:26 It takes time. Don't rush it. I only take the experts alerts because I haven't learned enough about trading to do my own. I'll be on a demo for that until I'm comfortable doing it on my own
2023-12-12 16:27:27 Same here I’ll be more patient moving forward 🫨🥰
2023-12-12 16:49:26 Is there a video on how to set up echo if we do have one where can I access it?
2023-12-12 16:50:27 I used the video to set the manara system and no difference not sure what else to do
2023-12-12 16:59:27 Contact support
2023-12-12 17:02:27 This is all part of the training and experience.   Learn candles, support & resistance and stuff.   Trades do not always hit TP.   Mike your SL to stay in profit if you want.   There is no real end all, be all answer.    

Alittle of something is better than a lot of nothing.  

You were up $100.   How big is your account ?    Up $100 on a $500 or $1000 account is huge.   $100 on a $100,000 account is nothing
2023-12-12 17:14:27 Hi guy's which eacho is the best to use?
2023-12-12 17:21:27 Gotcha I need to learn the candles forsure I am also still in demo
2023-12-12 17:25:02 🆕 SELL BTCUSD @ 41000 / TPs: 40000 - 39000 - 38000
2023-12-12 17:25:43 SL -150 🚫
2023-12-12 17:43:27 Ralph mentioned that Eacho 3 trades exactly the way he does, however I haven’t been really hearing anything good about Eacho yet so I paused mines until it gets better, I been sticking around with Ploutos 🔥
2023-12-12 17:44:27 You also need to be able to control your greed.
2023-12-12 17:44:53 TP1 +150 ✅
2023-12-12 17:47:27 It would be interesting to know if Ralph actually uses that or not. Just because it trades similar to how he trades doesn’t necessarily mean he’s using it nor does it mean that it actually works or is good for the common man.
2023-12-12 18:00:28 Right but he said he used it when asked. How good or efficient it works? That remains to be seen.
2023-12-12 18:12:25 Velkommen 🤗
2023-12-12 18:12:25 Right no and no one really has reported any success with the program

2023-12-12 18:55:35 So inspiring!!🤩🥹🙏🏻 I am about to start !
2023-12-13 03:09:27 AUDNZD didn't hit SL, currently about +22pips, if hit SL for you consider to change your broker
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Big time!, lot size a little too high but if you know what your doing it's okay..
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Happy birthday!! 🎁 ✨ Happy to have you here! 🫶🏼

2023-12-13 03:09:27 Happy birthday Jaycob!😀
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Happy Birthday 🎁🎉🎊
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Anyone have this issue?
2023-12-13 03:09:27 HAPPY BIRTHDAY JAYCOB! 🥳
2023-12-13 03:09:27 MT5 will be available soon
2023-12-13 03:09:27 It’s not yet. They’re integrating it into the eacho dashboard
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Thank you for the update
2023-12-13 03:09:27 I can only withdraw my profits in bitcoin, does anyone recommend an app to send it to which has low fees for withdrawing bitcoin?
2023-12-13 03:09:27 This is where having a trading plan can really help and guide you. I am currently on a small trading plan where I’m aiming to make $20 a day and I’m happy to risk $5 in stop loss to make $20. If one trade hits $20 even if it’s still going up I’ll close out and I’m done for the day. As you hit your trading plan goals you can start to increase your goals. There’s a great training in the ECA that Ralph does about trading plans and risk management to help guide you 🙏🏻 All the training to understand trades, Manara, candles, trends etc are all set up in ECA. I’ve found them to be really helpful ☺️
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Great logic I’m writing these things down so I can make a plan for myself as well thank you 😌
2023-12-13 03:09:27 This.  All of this
2023-12-13 03:09:27 I use Cashapp.   I will also make deposits/withdrawals by following BTC.  When BTC is up I’ll withdraw.   When it’s down I’ll buy
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Does it make a significant difference if you transfer it to your personal bank immediately after?
2023-12-13 03:09:27 For me no as I tx cash back and forth.
2023-12-13 03:09:27 I don’t wait or even set SL for these.  I get into profit and move my SL so it’s basically risk free trade.   The account is only $10 so at $0.50 profit is 5% 

10 $0.50 wins is $5 and. Do that for 2 days an I doubled my account 

It’s repetitive so if my account is $100 I can nearly double it in 2-3 days
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Had anyone ever tried depositing with vantage and gets this error message ?
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Yeah haopend a couple of times 
Vantage doesn’t suport some bank cards 
Just try IT with a different one
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Okay thank you
2023-12-13 03:09:27 I am having issue withdrawing from Vantage with my bank card that was used to do the deposit. What is the best way to do a withdrawal?
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Is it too late to pick up trade on XAUUSD gold today ?
2023-12-13 03:09:27 i think soo
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Yes
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Are we allowed to post team results to insta?? :)
2023-12-13 03:09:27 I think so yeah🤔
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Best it to look at it and analysis it when you see it.   Sometimes it’s good for mins….sometime hours
2023-12-13 03:09:27 good evening, i was wondering if someone could help me cancel my subscription? i love what this organization does but i personally haven’t learned much more than i already know abt trading and i didn’t realize that this was a subscription type deal :/
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Yes just need a disclaimer on the post to!
2023-12-13 03:09:27 I guess just don’t renew your subscription autoship date. Maybe gotta block it from auto processing from your bank or just contact support.
2023-12-13 03:09:27 You can delete your subscription from your back office under orders or autoship I believe
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Gold is up now, wow! Just a tiny bit😂
2023-12-13 03:09:27 I’m staring at right now haha
2023-12-13 03:09:27 🥲
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Charts have played with my heart today. Hoping for a fresh start tomorrow.
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Where can I find Ralph’s telegram channel
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Today, I’m having to remind myself that results are just about being in the right position at the right time. Its an objective game and I can’t let my feelings get in the way. Just do everything in my power to be  smart and calculated, and take what comes from there as continue learning opportunities. 🫡
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Log in portal , click on forex - ECA - log in and click on master class you’ll find it in the calendar
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Thank you so much!
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Oh I read that wrong that’s for the live sessions, The channels are under forex then click manara you’ll find the telegram links for both
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Wait for those alerts! I am. Its so difficult though 😂
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Same
2023-12-13 03:09:27 Sooo when can we expect eacho with mt5?
