2023-12-07 14:49:22 Anybody else took this gold trade that was sent out? This was on my demo account but STILL! TP 1&2 was hit in just under 5 minutes 🤯 

If so drop your results I would love to see them demo or live! 🙌
2023-12-07 14:58:22 i got out because i done the complete wrong lot size and made 50€ 😂
2023-12-07 14:58:38 i over leveraged it by so much on accident 😂😂😂
2023-12-07 15:04:09 Hey guys I have a question how do I add these blue marks in the trading view and the red marks too like this
2023-12-07 15:04:09 
2023-12-07 15:05:15 Suffering with success, Denny
2023-12-07 15:08:04 Its an indicator called Smart Money Concepts by LuxAlgo.
2023-12-07 15:12:09 Can it be found in the trading view ?
2023-12-07 15:12:16 exactly 😂😂
2023-12-07 15:12:16 Yes.
2023-12-07 15:13:09 Okay thanks and if it’s case where it’s been added I only see sell box that means the trade is the sell section right ?
2023-12-07 15:14:09 If your using the free version they only allow 2 indicators.
2023-12-07 15:14:09 Okay understood I think it’s the free version though
2023-12-07 15:15:09 Usually it shows both sell amd buy opportunities. When it's in the blue box look for buy opportunities, when it hits the red box look for sell opportunities. Always have more than one method of confirmation though.
2023-12-07 15:16:09 Oh okay but I just added it only seeing sell boxes
2023-12-07 15:17:09 Red?
2023-12-07 15:18:09 Has anybody tried new product echo or whatever is called
2023-12-07 15:26:36 A win is still a win! 🏆
2023-12-07 15:27:39 Hey I’m gonna drop a video please listen 👂 this might help everyone for a next time around if they over leverage! 💕
2023-12-07 15:28:15 
2023-12-07 15:35:09 .01 per $100 is a good guide
2023-12-07 15:36:09 Several have.  Haven’t heard anything really good about it yet
2023-12-07 15:37:09 If you just added it, it may take some time to get up to speed.  Give it time.
2023-12-07 15:37:09 Have had no movement with it whatsoever, have multiple support tickets open since starting week but still no word
2023-12-07 15:37:09 Okay
2023-12-07 15:48:10 I have had some success with Eacho
2023-12-07 15:50:10 👀
2023-12-07 15:51:10 How does it work. Like manara?
2023-12-07 15:55:55 What happens for me is everyday at around 4 oclock Cali time i get a notification on here asking to agree to let Eacho Trade on my behalf and thats the only thing i have to click for the trades to come through. Yesterday i had 4 come through and 3 of them won however last night i had 3 come through that lost. also i noticed if you do any activity on the MT4 account that Eacho is attached to Eacho will pause. Doenst matter what activity is like canceling an order or placing a trade Eacho will pause. I learned that the hard way when i was trading on it thinking it was my other account and i didnt get any trades from Eacho for like a week and a half.
2023-12-07 15:58:10 Hold the phone…you’re saying that for Eacho to work, you can trade yourself as well?
2023-12-07 15:58:10 NOT ON THE SAME MT4 IT WILL PAUSE
2023-12-07 15:59:10 I was waiting for Eacho to work with MT5 but I don’t intend to stop trading. That’s a deal breaker for me. Tisk tisk. They didn’t mention that in the call when they were pitching it.
2023-12-07 15:59:10 No wonder it was pausing for me smh, yeah they definitely never mentioned that.
2023-12-07 15:59:10 hold on let me send a voice clip
2023-12-07 16:01:10 
2023-12-07 16:02:10 
2023-12-07 16:03:10 Just create a special account for Eacho, that's what I did.
2023-12-07 16:03:10 same
2023-12-07 16:04:10 For me Eacho just seems like the lazy man’s way of entering trades.  Like all it seems to me is that instead of me hitting JPYUSA - execute….it does it for me.  

Have yet to actually hear any success stories (including P\L)
2023-12-07 16:05:10 Ehhh…I think I’m out. That did it for me.

I think I’ve been mildly successful  up enough on my own so far.
2023-12-07 16:06:10 That's the point of automated trading
2023-12-07 16:06:10 Is that Eacho or your own trading?
2023-12-07 16:07:10 Not everyone has time to enter trades themselves or analyze
2023-12-07 16:07:10 Its only lazy is Eacho is all they rely on. How i see it is this: Eacho runs in the background while you trade on your normal account. im treating it like a savings account while i build my main account
2023-12-07 16:07:10 That’s my own trading. Which is why I don’t want to stop to let Eacho take over. I thought it was supposed to take trades with me not in place of me.
2023-12-07 16:07:10 This was just Eacho ?
2023-12-07 16:08:04 No. Me.
2023-12-07 16:08:04 If you already have eacho, you could just create another account with the profits of your own trading. Just a thought. You're doing great!
2023-12-07 16:09:11 So is like EA robot trading for you
2023-12-07 16:09:11 I would let Eacho run on another MT4 while you trade on your main one
2023-12-07 16:09:11 Did you have to upload some files on Mt4
2023-12-07 16:09:11 Gotcha.  So again not really seeing the Eacho results that were so hyped up about
2023-12-07 16:09:28 3 wins and 3 losses is not the 80% reported
2023-12-07 16:09:38 Just your Meta Trader info
2023-12-07 16:09:38 I did. I could kick myself for my closing at 300 PIPS
2023-12-07 16:10:10 Thanks, I just don’t want to make another deposit and have another account to look after. It seems like a lot of effort for not a lot of payoff. I’ve had one eacho trade that failed so I was on the fence about it to begin with.
2023-12-07 16:11:10 Also I’ve switched fully to MT5 so as of yet it’s still not available with MT5 anyway. 🤷‍♂️
2023-12-07 16:12:10 I think you need to give it some time but sounds is good
2023-12-07 16:20:50 1000 PIPS🤯
2023-12-07 16:37:11 
2023-12-07 16:37:11 How can I withdraw on vantage?
2023-12-07 16:40:11 Yea
2023-12-07 16:41:11 What lot size should I use for 5,000.00 trading accounts
2023-12-07 16:41:11 Looks like a call to customer service might be needed
2023-12-07 16:41:11 .01 per $100
2023-12-07 16:41:11 From Masari….

Important Notice: Platform Upgrade and Migration
Dear Valued Clients,
 
I hope this message finds you well. We are writing to inform you of an upcoming critical upgrade and migration of our platform scheduled for this weekend.
 
As part of our ongoing commitment to enhancing your trading experience, we have been diligently working on transitioning to MetaTrader 5 (MT5) due to the discontinuation of MT4 across various brands within the industry. We are excited to announce that we have found a solution that we believe will significantly enhance your trading journey with us.
 
 
Please note that this process is intricate and time-intensive. To ensure a seamless transition, we will be pausing all trading activities two hours before the market closes on Friday, December 8th. While our team will exert every effort to migrate all accounts to MT5 with our partner brand before the market reopens on Sunday, we must emphasize that successful migration within this timeframe cannot be guaranteed.
 
During the migration period, all open trades will be transferred; however, the ability to add or close positions will be temporarily restricted. We strongly recommend setting stop-loss and take-profit levels on existing trades or closing positions before the trading pause to mitigate any potential inconvenience.
 
Upon completion of the migration, detailed instructions on accessing your trades within the new MT5 accounts will be sent to your registered email addresses promptly.
 
We are committed to keeping you informed throughout this transition and will provide regular updates via email. Your attention to these communications will be crucial in staying abreast of the progress made during this transition phase.
 
Thank you for your understanding and cooperation as we endeavor to bring you an improved trading platform. Should you have any queries or require further assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to our support team.
 
Best regards,
The Masari Team
2023-12-07 16:42:11 No more than .5 TOTAL in open trades
2023-12-07 16:42:11 
2023-12-07 16:43:11 Okay
2023-12-07 16:46:11 
2023-12-07 16:46:11 Sorry I didn't see someone is posted already
2023-12-07 16:54:05 Velkommen Marcin!
2023-12-07 16:54:36 Velkommen Marcin💫
2023-12-07 16:54:59 Velkommen 😍😍
2023-12-07 16:55:20 Velkommen
2023-12-07 16:55:22 Velkommen💛
2023-12-07 16:55:31 1000 pips what?
2023-12-07 16:55:46 Velkommen🫶🏽
2023-12-07 16:56:01 Velkommen ❤️
2023-12-07 16:57:03 I was looking at Angel’s Demo account and she earned almost 1000 PIPS from one trade
2023-12-07 16:58:31 as far as i know all the pips added up on the gold trade are 139 pips total
2023-12-07 16:58:54 or are you including lot size?
2023-12-07 17:00:07 I saw the 98.60 US on her account and thought that was 1000 PIPS
2023-12-07 17:01:03 the pips you gai. arent defined by how much money you make, they represent the general movement of a trade, gold in this case
2023-12-07 17:01:25 for example 2020 to 2021 is 10 pips as far as i know
2023-12-07 17:01:48 so 2020 to 2030 would be 100 and 2020 to 2120 would be 1000 pips
2023-12-07 17:02:22 but i see where youre coming from
2023-12-07 17:37:35 
2023-12-07 17:38:23 I’ve been studying and placing trades exclusively with gold for the past two weeks. I’m obsessed with how it moves! 😆😍 this was today from the gold alert we got sent.
2023-12-07 17:39:27 I could’ve held on longer… because it plummeted all the way down to 2020. But I digress. This is amazing progress regardless.
2023-12-07 17:48:48 
2023-12-07 17:54:27 Aweee you are too sweet! Thank you :) these are my results on demo so far but I’ve been consistently profitable for two weeks now as I’m building my skills. It’s a promising trajectory!
2023-12-07 17:55:06 Live or demo it’s still profit! 🙌💕
2023-12-07 17:56:12 Oh my goodness 😳 tell me the secret lol just kidding. This Is awesome 👌
2023-12-07 17:56:34 One thing that really encouraged me was I did my own analysis this morning, and it was for the exact movement that was later called out as a trade idea by the experts that served as double confirmation. it was awesome .
2023-12-07 17:57:13 Absolutely! I’m seriously flabbergasted that the only thing between me and actually withdrawing those kind of profits is that the account happenedDDD to not be live !! 🤣😍
2023-12-07 17:57:29 Because with these kinds of results, you know that the potential is there
2023-12-07 18:19:42 This is the email I got from hankotrade
