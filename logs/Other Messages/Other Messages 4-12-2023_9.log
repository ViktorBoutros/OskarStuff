2023-12-04 09:54:00 Just to clarify we transitioned from Masari to Hankotrade?
2023-12-04 09:56:50 Trade closed +70 👉 Price at entry again
2023-12-04 10:38:32 https://www.tradingview.com/x/OuRmKLQ6/
2023-12-04 10:41:36 Dow Jones map in my eyes 🔥 Retracement then a big new bounce up. Stay tuned 💪
2023-12-04 12:04:02 Did you notice that just DXY market is open and all other indeces are closed market in Trading View?
2023-12-04 12:06:02 AXY, BXY, CXY, EXY, JXY, SXY and ZXY are closed.
2023-12-04 12:18:03 Weird that's why probably gold went crazy today whole market is weird
2023-12-04 12:18:27 +80 ✅ Book
2023-12-04 12:33:14 +600 pips since opening now 👍 Amazing start of this week 🔥
2023-12-04 12:43:03 When I want to transfer money back to my cashapp, since you have to do it on bitcoin, how do you get it from bitcoin to usd currency? And is there a fee?
2023-12-04 13:35:45 All indices are open. Yeaaah. 😊
2023-12-04 13:39:04 Are some of y’all trading NAS100 Cash?
2023-12-04 13:40:04 When was last manara update in usa
2023-12-04 13:51:16 +70 ✅
2023-12-04 13:58:26 Is there a way to determine which trades to take from manara or do you just take each one…..? Confused!
2023-12-04 13:59:05 Why does Pluto's trade for gold say they hit 70 pips when it hasn't even hit tp yet? Makes no sense
2023-12-04 14:00:05 I’ve been wondering the same thing
2023-12-04 14:00:05 I'm curious if they are cashing out n not saying anything
2023-12-04 14:02:05 Gold is doing what they say it was going to do though
2023-12-04 14:03:05 Mines hit SL 😅. Idk if it’s a broker issue or just an error on their end.
2023-12-04 14:03:05 Yea this time
2023-12-04 14:03:05 What did you put your sl at?
2023-12-04 14:03:05 Different broker and probably they entered a bit earlier
2023-12-04 14:04:05 I set it to exactly what theirs was
2023-12-04 14:04:05 The one they just sent out?
2023-12-04 14:05:05 Yup, this happened to me before. I entered exactly when they did and they said TP but it hit SL for me. I’ve had more gains with them than losses though but still it’s strange.
2023-12-04 14:05:05 That is so odd. Mine is going down like they said. Who's your broker?
2023-12-04 14:06:05 Or sometimes they say TP and mines would still be running
2023-12-04 14:06:05 I’m using Hankotrade
2023-12-04 14:07:03 TP1 +110 ✅
2023-12-04 14:08:05 Oh OK. I have finesse. Maybe that's the issue. I put in 2 trades from that and they both hit
2023-12-04 14:09:05 Now they say tp1 just hit +110. Maybe they were saying +70 at that point of time
2023-12-04 14:09:05 Yeah I also have finesse, but a demo account. I’m gonna switch over after I play around with it for awhile.
2023-12-04 14:10:05 The spreads are pretty good for finesse.
2023-12-04 14:10:05 And commissions aren't that bad either
2023-12-04 14:10:05 I have never changed brokers so much in my life 😂. Ever since this Masari mess I feel like I had like 4 different brokers already lol.
2023-12-04 14:12:05 I know right 🤣. I switched 3xs 😆 glad they found us one.  It's awesome to see the customers come first
2023-12-04 14:13:05 Yeah it’s been so much going on. Even Hankotrade is having issues with MT4/MT5 mobile. I had to open my live account on the PC until they resolve whatever is going on.
2023-12-04 14:14:05 When was last manara update
2023-12-04 14:14:05 I'm sorry to hear that. People can't even find that broker on mt4/mt5
2023-12-04 14:16:05 Yeah I talked with support and they told me their team is working on it to get it back on there, it’s a minor inconvenience but patience is key.
2023-12-04 14:17:05 At this rate I’m just like “finesse, I’m coming home baby” 😂
2023-12-04 14:18:35 TP2 +170 ✅ Trade fully closed
2023-12-04 14:19:05 Lol. Yeah their support seems dookie. Come to the good side my guy 😆
2023-12-04 14:20:05 Damn tp2 just hit. I knew I should've did that one also. All good made my quota for the day 😆
2023-12-04 14:21:25 watch ralph‘s eca videos, he explains it
2023-12-04 14:21:33 Ty!
2023-12-04 14:22:05 Love to see it bro!
2023-12-04 14:22:28 One of my GOLD trades 👍
2023-12-04 14:23:25 Me also bc I did a stupid mistake by taking a gold trade last night, didn't trust my gut n got out at -160 but once I did it went straight to my tp, so I would've made profit lol
I'm back at even now
2023-12-04 14:24:20 Damn I know you was mad af but glad you got it back 🫡
2023-12-04 14:25:05 I’m practicing for another week on demo then ima go live 🙌 but thanks for the recommendation definitely will get finesse
2023-12-04 14:26:00 Omg was I. The entire time in my demo I let everything ride and was 75-80% successful. And the first trade I took I went opposite 😆 but I'm also glad I got it back. Thank God for Gold!
2023-12-04 14:26:00 You're welcome.
2023-12-04 14:28:05 Gold is so rewarding man. It’s my favorite thing. Can be very volatile but super rewarding.
2023-12-04 14:29:05 Take your time but remember it's 90% mental, take the trade n let ride. You'll win n lose some. Always trust your gut
2023-12-04 14:29:05 You seen that screenshot on Ploutos? Bro I can’t wait to start hitting trades like that. Our time coming 💯
2023-12-04 14:30:05 Yes it is. I've learned that in the past 2 days. The hard way lol
2023-12-04 14:30:05 Omg yes. His/her account must be 10,000 or more. We will get there
2023-12-04 14:31:05 I was like damn.... can't want do reach that goal, I'll be set
2023-12-04 14:31:05 Wait*
2023-12-04 14:31:05 To*
2023-12-04 14:32:05 I’m telling you man. One trade can set you up and you can just chill for a bit. It’s insane man
2023-12-04 14:32:05 That was one of their own trades as well not an alert.
2023-12-04 14:33:05 Yes it can just have to be a little cautious with gold
2023-12-04 14:33:05 Oh I know, it’s so inspiring to see stuff like that.
2023-12-04 14:33:05 Yes it is. Time to learn the gold charts. Nothing else 😆
2023-12-04 14:34:05 Yup I was always told to stick to one good pair you like and just go with that, trading a million different pairs can be confusing imo.
2023-12-04 14:34:43 Isn’t Ploutos only for indices?
2023-12-04 14:35:05 Omg yes. Learned that in the demo. Gold will be our friend, possibly best friends. Only if gold keeps treating was well 😆
2023-12-04 14:35:38 Yes I believe so
2023-12-04 14:37:05 Not only but mostly
2023-12-04 14:38:05 But Pluto is super active today 🥰
2023-12-04 14:38:05 Ok thanks. It’s live trading, right?
2023-12-04 14:38:05 Yes
2023-12-04 14:38:05 Yea
2023-12-04 14:39:05 But make sure to read the disclaimer pinned at top of page
2023-12-04 14:59:26 So I'm a little confused how this happened: Eacho put in a trade at 5:20am while I was sleeping. I'm in the US so I thought I had to click "Accept" for trade ideas🤔 It closed the trade shortly after putting me at -$8.52
2023-12-04 15:20:45 Nasdaq and our level 15300 will hit. Hence, hold on our past trades and we might sell again. Be ready!
2023-12-04 15:30:06 Hey guys ! Started to practice the trading w a demo account and just seems to easy?😭  any pointers to how things should fall in order ? To make sure I’m doing this correctly
2023-12-04 15:35:32 +70 ✅ Book
2023-12-04 15:40:06 225pips is very good. 😉
2023-12-04 15:41:16 Could be the spread or time.  Gold can move VERY fast.  If the TP is 2040 and that’s what you set TP at, but the spread is 25…..the trade actually has to hit 2065 to close.
2023-12-04 15:41:59 TP1 +200 ✅
2023-12-04 15:42:33 Mine all hit this morning. My spreads seem ok. But makes sense
2023-12-04 15:44:06 Can someone help me with colors pls i get the colors on the left side wgen looking on the screen but I cant get de numbers on the right in colors
2023-12-04 15:44:06 Can someone help me with this
2023-12-04 15:44:53 +70 ✅
2023-12-04 15:44:53 Reds are losses and blues are gains
2023-12-04 15:44:53 The color on the right the red one means your trade will hit sl & green one means your trade will hit Tp
2023-12-04 15:45:04 Red is what you’re loosing and blue is what you’re winning
2023-12-04 15:46:06 Yes i know the means but how do i get it in color all of mine is in black on white
2023-12-04 15:46:06 I’m doing exactly what manara  says that I am always losing profit
2023-12-04 15:46:06 But thanks for the explanation guys ❤️ I just need to get the numbets in colors 😊
2023-12-04 15:47:06 Why
2023-12-04 15:48:07 The trades in manara or any trade for the matter doesn't mean you'll always win. Choose trades that are high risk/reward and trades that are in entry or slightly out of entry. Then let it ride
2023-12-04 15:48:07 Change the background.

I just change from light to dark and all was in color like you see.
2023-12-04 15:49:06 Also your lot size as well
2023-12-04 15:49:07 You still need to look at the chart and determine if the trade meets your trading plan or not
2023-12-04 15:49:49 Did that to and still i didnt get the numbers in color
2023-12-04 15:49:58 Thanks  family
2023-12-04 15:57:07 In my MT4 I have just this 3 options.

You can look if you have other settings which you can change your color in your behave.
2023-12-04 16:02:07 I trade in the MT5 and exact same options I have and yet it doesnt change so weird
2023-12-04 16:03:06 
2023-12-04 16:03:06 Let be than 😊
2023-12-04 16:03:06 AND AFTER
2023-12-04 16:03:19 USD INDEX
2023-12-04 16:15:57 I don’t know if it’s just me but manara is not working, it won’t open up and the last notification I got was Friday.
2023-12-04 16:19:07 Do the alert thing again to receive notifications for it. It usually stops sending notifications at market close on Friday and sometimes it resumes on its own but sometimes you have to manually reset it.
2023-12-04 16:25:07 It won’t even open for me to do that, it’s just blank
2023-12-04 16:27:07 Try open from back office.
2023-12-04 16:29:07 The telegram channel for manara wont open?
2023-12-04 16:30:07 Manara itself
2023-12-04 16:39:49 Oh no! Are you using a live account?

I’m still trying to connect my demo with eacho on MT4 to get the hang of it before going live but still need to connect my broker since I can’t find it on the list.

Other than that- how has it been going for eacho? Any thoughts
2023-12-04 16:42:26 Fikk nettopp denne kmt😭 folk vet virkelig ikke hva de snakker om 🤣😭
2023-12-04 16:46:08 Did it ask you to enter a pin?
2023-12-04 16:49:08 Yes that part is good, it’s just that when I get in it’s blank
2023-12-04 16:51:55 Still in a demo account with HankoTrade. Sent an email to support so I'll see what they say. Was just curious if anyone else had the same issue. TBH Eacho has been a pain, I've been pulling my hair trying to get it set up and am sending requests and emails daily 😵‍💫
2023-12-04 17:00:08 Hmmm that’s so strange, maybe you have to close everything out and retry or contact support in your back office and see what they can do.
2023-12-04 17:01:11 Min is working just fine i am logging in with my phone so maybe you must contact support
2023-12-04 17:04:08 Yes I just did, they told me to close everything and start over
2023-12-04 17:08:13 At what time did you “accept” before the trade happen?
2023-12-04 17:09:08 Hopefully that works for you
2023-12-04 17:09:08 Yes it did, thanks
2023-12-04 17:11:01 The notification is just the same as it was before so what should I do to start getting notifications again?
2023-12-04 17:30:08 Check the settings for notifications if is still the same or not.
2023-12-04 17:30:38 Tomorrow Tuesday 5th December

2023-12-04 17:32:44 She didn’t accept the trade is what she’s trying to say. We get notifications asking us to “agree for trade execution” through telegram
2023-12-04 17:33:26 I would definitely be patiently waiting for a tutorial on eacho on how to properly execute trades and such. Would be so beneficial if there is one!
2023-12-04 17:34:20 Bror han der bor på kommentarfeltet mitt
2023-12-04 17:34:26 Han vil ikke lære
2023-12-04 17:34:31 Bare la han være 😂😂

2023-12-04 17:35:01 Bare spre kjærlighet til alle som hater, de vet ikke bedre ❤️❤️

2023-12-04 18:07:09 Welcome to the team Dr.Monir. 🤗
2023-12-04 18:24:09 What do y’all use to get the signals? Just manara?
2023-12-04 18:40:10 Manara and Pluto's channel
2023-12-04 18:41:10 I usually do my own trades in manara. Pick them I mean
2023-12-04 18:42:10 for those on the finesse fx on demo did yall put currency USD and what do i put on leverage ?
2023-12-04 18:43:10 Usd. You can do 1:200 or 1:500. I'm using 1:500 in my live account
2023-12-04 18:44:10 Where can I find the Pluto’s channel?
2023-12-04 18:45:10 In the back office. You'll have to purchase for $25. Worth it
2023-12-04 18:47:10 Can anyone show a live trade w real money ? Very new and pretty lost only practicing in meta trade
2023-12-04 18:58:10 It's the same concept just with fake money
2023-12-04 19:02:10 Has anyone had good result using EACHO?
2023-12-04 19:08:10 For those with finesse which demo do I select ecn demo or zero demo .?
2023-12-04 19:15:10 I think that is ECN, if I remember correctly. And for live too.
2023-12-04 19:37:26 Done for today guys 👍 Rest well for tomorrow ☺️ +1030 pips are collected today 💸 Congratulations 🎊
2023-12-04 19:55:11 That’s what I thought too
