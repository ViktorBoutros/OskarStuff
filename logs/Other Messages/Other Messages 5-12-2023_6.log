2023-12-05 12:38:13 Thanks much
2023-12-05 12:47:13 Hey, 
Is anyone else having issues receiving trades from Manara on telegram? The last ones I got were late Sunday night.
2023-12-05 12:48:13 I received one at 6:08 central time today
2023-12-05 12:49:13 Yeah so it must be mine! How do I fix that?
2023-12-05 12:49:13 I have not been receiving
2023-12-05 12:50:13 Oh that’s weird that some people are and some aren’t
2023-12-05 12:50:13 I was receiving then it just stopped Sunday 😕
2023-12-05 12:51:13 I'll check my manara quick
2023-12-05 12:51:13 I think you have to go back in and confirm that you want to keep receiving the telegram messages once a week, if I'm not mistaken.
2023-12-05 12:52:13 Go to your notifications and Make a watch list then hit the telegram button. See if that helps.
2023-12-05 12:53:13 Just redo the verification
2023-12-05 12:53:13 It only sends out signals that hit entry. I get some but not alot. Depends on the day I suppose
2023-12-05 12:53:13 And it should work
2023-12-05 12:56:13 Ok I’ll try
2023-12-05 13:17:31 +120 ✅
2023-12-05 13:58:09 For those of you that are having problems logging into your back office like I was, I got it fixed last night. This time the person at the chat bot was very helpful.
Log into Eaconomy, tap the home button at top left, then tap the settings button. Go to the account tab, tap the pencil at top right. Put your password in, and then put a new password in, and then confirm the new password. Check the little box stating that you are changing your password and then save. Relog into Eaconomy with new password and then log into learn ECA with new password.
2023-12-05 14:33:56 Silver........... Gonna start trading it soon
2023-12-05 14:45:03 Hei alle sammen! Jeg lurte på om det var noen som kanksje kunne hjulpet meg. Jeg får ikke logget inn på ECA.. er det noen andre som sliter med det ?
2023-12-05 14:46:19 Jeg fikk meg inn uten problem, usikker hva det kan være🤭 prøvd å restarte siden , eller med glemt passord?
2023-12-05 14:46:32 Har prøvd å endre passordet men da står det at brukernavnet mitt ikke finnes. Men det er når jeg skriver inn email min. Det det er ikke mulig og skrive inn Username på min innlogging om det er det som er tilfelle.
2023-12-05 14:47:03 Har prøvd begge deler. Får ikke endret passordet heller.
2023-12-05 14:48:49 Hmm.. så rart, kanskje du må skrive til kundeservice så de kan sende deg nytt passord og riktig brukernavn. Eller vente å se om noen andre har samme problem nå
2023-12-05 14:49:24 Har prøvd å kontoakte de også. Men de var ikke til noe hjelp.
2023-12-05 14:49:47 Hmm, det er rart, hva sa kundeservice?
2023-12-05 14:52:42 💪 Hold on the GOLD 🥇 1st time I trade Silver. Trying it now. Silver is so risky so I must try it myself before placing any signal here. It's pip is x10 of gold
2023-12-05 14:53:20 
2023-12-05 14:57:49 +90 ✅ Book before the news
2023-12-05 15:05:15 I would recommend using realistic lot sizes.
2023-12-05 15:06:15 SELL XAUUSD

2023-12-05 15:08:49 I havent been receiving manara trades either. Last one was from sunday
2023-12-05 15:10:18 In today's "What is Eacho Doing" episode: I was sent a trade request yesterday afternoon but never received confirmation if it closed. I log into Eacho and see nothing is trading or recently closed 😵‍💫
2023-12-05 15:11:19 GM - Does anyone else have trouble with their Metatrader 4 demo account? Mine is saying authorization failed and this is the second demo account it has done this too.
2023-12-05 15:13:09 Randy you just have to reconnect your manara sometimes she unconents from telegram for some reason
2023-12-05 15:14:32 Yess i was in the middle of a trade when it happened and just got me out of the trade
2023-12-05 15:15:14 Do you create a whole new one?
2023-12-05 15:17:18 TP2 SMASHED +50 PIPS… ALL IN 10 MINS LETS GOOOO✅✅🔨🔨

2023-12-05 15:37:53 +70 ✅
2023-12-05 15:46:16 it’s the same thing you did to receive notifications

2023-12-05 16:01:03 TP4 HIT AS WELL +150 PIPS 🤫✅
2023-12-05 16:02:16 Is there a certain amount of balance you have to have in order to sell gold or buy gold?
2023-12-05 16:05:16 They recommend 1000 plus
2023-12-05 16:05:16 You can do with smaller just have to have small lot sizes. .01-.02
2023-12-05 16:06:16 I try it still wasnt sllowing me but then again i only hv 100
2023-12-05 16:06:16 Nxt time lol
2023-12-05 16:09:17 Ok thank you
2023-12-05 16:09:17 I know I was just testing out some things
2023-12-05 16:16:16 How do I refresh it to receive trades again?
2023-12-05 16:17:16 I’m new and still learning everything
2023-12-05 16:17:16 Same here
2023-12-05 16:18:16 Trade closed +120 👉 Price at entry again
2023-12-05 16:18:16 Ok thank you👌🏾
2023-12-05 16:18:16 Yeah I'd wait til you have more funds
2023-12-05 16:18:16 How do you reconnect though?
2023-12-05 16:18:16 I just tried doing it and it said my link has expired e
2023-12-05 16:18:21 Once you do, get into gold but be smart about it..not greedy lol
2023-12-05 16:19:16 Is it still going
2023-12-05 16:19:16 Or did tps hit already
2023-12-05 16:21:16 Still going. 3/4 hit with manara trades and ideas channel. Pluto's trade is still going strong
2023-12-05 16:31:03 Anyone ever have an issue where your broker just made a bid disappear? I set it, I was in the middle of scalping another pair when it entered and hit TP and now it’s just gone as if I never put it in.
2023-12-05 16:34:16 In another group and others having the same problem.
2023-12-05 16:34:16 Yes.  It depends on the. Rocker and covering the spread.  If the spread is 112 and you only have 100 you can not trade it.  You need enough to cover and room for loss.
2023-12-05 16:34:16 What broker ?

Was it a pending order or was it executed?
2023-12-05 16:53:17 FinesseFX. Just moved to them this morning. It was a pending order and then executed. I literally watched it execute and then hit TP. And then when I went to the history it’s not there.
2023-12-05 16:55:17 Mt5?
2023-12-05 16:56:17 If so I've had that issue with a trade last night. It didn't show up til this morning due to the times are different
2023-12-05 16:56:17 But they all should show up
2023-12-05 16:58:17 Yep. No it didn’t register at all. The balance does not reflect it and every trade I took after is on there and reflected in the balance. They literally made my trade disappear.
2023-12-05 17:00:17 I was going to say the same thing. Having a demo account with 100k gives a false sense of security. You end up making trades with lot sizes that are unrealistic and when you create a live account with a few hundred, you can blow it on a single trade. I like the Finesse broker because it lets you deposit exactly how much you want to start with. Instead of choosing an exorbitant amount of money. It makes the demo account much more realistic and makes learning easier.
2023-12-05 17:06:17 When I was able to use a hanko trade demo it allowed me to have a realistic amount of 100 and would notify me when a lot size was way over my head
2023-12-05 17:06:17 That is super odd.
2023-12-05 17:07:17 What was the trade?
2023-12-05 17:09:17 GBPUSD
2023-12-05 17:10:17 I know there was news on USD but that shouldn't reflect your trade for disappearing. Maybe overleverage a trade?
2023-12-05 17:13:09 No. Again I literary watched it open and hit TP. I was sitting right in front of my computer when it happed. Asides from I don't over leverage and it was the only trade active at that moment.
2023-12-05 17:18:17 Can someone please explain what the swap is? I’ve tried looking it up but I just don’t understand. Sometimes I make money off of it and sometimes I lose money off of it. I don’t understand what it is or how it works.
2023-12-05 17:21:17 It's when you leave a trade running overnight. It's a fee the broker charges. Changes per pair/lot size.
2023-12-05 17:24:01 Trade closed +70 👉 Price at entry again.
2023-12-05 17:25:17 No way you’re making money on a swap.   Swap is a fee to over over from 1 session (day) to the next.   It’s a fee you’re paying
2023-12-05 17:26:17 
2023-12-05 17:26:17 I made $4.63 on the swap
2023-12-05 17:29:17 You can see from the picture that it cancelled out my commission and I ended up with a 43 cent gain.
2023-12-05 17:34:17 That’s the 1st time I’m seeing that as a positive. All my swaps are negative 😂
2023-12-05 17:36:35 🙋🏻‍♀️
2023-12-05 17:37:09 That Gold Trade went quick😵‍💫
2023-12-05 17:37:09 Yeah I know it can happen, I just don’t understand the circumstances under which it happened.
2023-12-05 17:37:16 Same here. I have been copying and pasting my info multiple times too. No luck 😔
2023-12-05 17:38:14 once it said sell gold i just spammed on the sell button and then put in my SL & TP after it wasnt to bad
2023-12-05 17:39:17 This is just a quick thing from Google that I found.
2023-12-05 17:39:17 
2023-12-05 17:39:29 I don’t know if that’s what I managed to do or not, like I said, I really don’t understand it. I just know that it happened.
2023-12-05 17:40:17 It happens if you bought/sell it while spread was better than it at the time of closing. It happened to me many times
2023-12-05 17:40:17 Spread was very small at the time you took the trade
2023-12-05 17:41:17 Oh! Oh that makes sense! I don’t remember what the spread was when I took the gold trade but that makes perfect sense, thank you!!
2023-12-05 17:43:10 Np ☺️
2023-12-05 17:44:17 I like it and I’d like to duplicate it if I’m able. I essentially paid nothing for the trades I made. Good deal in my book.
2023-12-05 17:46:04 Heyy… how can I find all Ralph videos in the eca
2023-12-05 17:59:17 Go to Forex -> ECA (learneca.club)-> Live Trading Sessions -> Forex LTS -> Manara -> Forex & Manara Training ✅

They are still uploading the videos and will be adding more 🙌
2023-12-05 18:06:18 Can you turn it into a full screen because its not giving the option to
2023-12-05 18:07:18 Yes just click the title above it and it will show other videos
2023-12-05 18:09:18 Wether you click intro, advanced or past weekly sessions, more videos for that section will pop up. I guess they’re still loading more videos soon cause that’s not all, he has tons more.
2023-12-05 18:17:18 Thanks I was the same problem.
2023-12-05 18:23:18 I can't open that section. What can be wrong?
2023-12-05 18:27:18 Can someone drop the brokers & trading platforms you're using currently I would appreciate it
2023-12-05 18:28:10 I want to go live and don't want to wait on masari
2023-12-05 18:32:10 Same thing happened  to me, I submitted  a ticket, since support was not available, I even created a new demo mt4 account. No thing has worked and am still waiting on support to get back to me

2023-12-05 18:47:34 
2023-12-05 18:51:56 On mt4 or mt5 I can’t find the broker name searched under”Herofx” am I typing in the name correctly?
2023-12-05 18:52:50 
2023-12-05 18:54:18 You're awesome thank you
2023-12-05 19:14:18 For those who have switched to finessefx, are we to use usd or bitcoin?
2023-12-05 19:14:18 
2023-12-05 19:16:04 I selected USD, then I could put the dollar amount to put into the account. I wouldn't have a clue how much bitcoin that relates to.
2023-12-05 19:16:19 Is your account working with usd?
2023-12-05 19:17:19 Yes it is
2023-12-05 19:27:00 I need help haven't received anything from Manara since last Thursday tried to activate again still nothing also signed up for Eacho was told to hold off on getting broker because they should be switching to Metatrader 5 my enroller hasn't responded back to me yet it's been a few days
2023-12-05 19:27:19 
2023-12-05 19:31:04 Still haven't been receiving either
2023-12-05 19:37:19 I have had to get IT support involved when this happened to me.   I have tried the alerts and user ID thing all the time and didn’t work.  It was a daily thing for me.  Terrible

As for Eacho there are too many issues and I would personally advise to hold off for a while on it
2023-12-05 19:49:19 Me either and I’ve already reset mine
2023-12-05 19:50:19 That’s what it’s been feeling like for me too, an everyday thing.
2023-12-05 19:51:19 One thing also is to log in on the computer like 1x every day or 2.  It was something about keeping the program updated and showing its use or something
2023-12-05 19:51:19 It’s a pain
2023-12-05 19:53:19 That’s even with me logging in multiple times throughout the day.
2023-12-05 20:05:19 Same.  Been there.   Contact support
2023-12-05 20:07:19 What’d you put for leverage?
2023-12-05 20:07:19 500:1

2023-12-05 22:53:22 The best thing is to learn to analyze, no matter how long it takes, as price action is the key to a trader's success. No AI tools like Manara or Echo will help goals.
2023-12-05 23:02:55 Oh I’m well aware.  My post is that there was a ton of hype and it just fizzled out
2023-12-06 00:31:23 Hey I have a problem with my manara since lately can someone please assist me because I am going on in see the chart but when I go over to monitor it’s blank also notification section blank I don’t know what’s the issue
2023-12-06 00:32:23 And I restart the manara and it’s still not showing
2023-12-06 00:32:55 That happened to me too but after I logged out and reopened , everything worked fine.
2023-12-06 00:33:23 Okay going to try log out and login back
2023-12-06 00:53:41 My manara chart will not load at all…
2023-12-06 00:54:22 Q”
2023-12-06 00:55:12 if Manara is giving you issues. Please try closing out completely and opening it back up. That usually fixes mine.
2023-12-06 00:55:24 Okay I will try ty

2023-12-06 08:02:30 Has anyone else had this problem with FinesseFX? This trade was only supposed to cost me $20 if it hit SL. They completely ignored my set SL and closed it when they wanted costing me $120.
2023-12-06 08:25:30 I talked to support and they’re opening a ticket to look into it.

2023-12-06 11:22:15 +120 ✅ Book please. Today there is oil news
2023-12-06 11:28:12 Is anyone else having this problem or just you?
2023-12-06 11:28:12 With the broker
2023-12-06 12:08:34 I don’t know. It was my first day with that broker and I have 3 trades that went over $100 in loss that weren’t supposed to. I’m waiting to see what support tells me.
2023-12-06 12:50:34 Hi guys, do you have a good manara training video please? Some trades I choose to take really don’t work. What other confirmation you guys use? Plz 🥺
2023-12-06 12:50:34 Have you joined in on Ralph’s lives sessions at all?
2023-12-06 13:04:39 SL -150 🚫
2023-12-06 13:41:33 What’s gold in the mt5
2023-12-06 13:41:33 Xauusd
2023-12-06 13:41:33 XAUUSD
2023-12-06 13:41:33 XAUUSD
2023-12-06 13:42:01 Okay thanks
2023-12-06 13:45:35 You really have to do your own analysis with it the last few trades I’ve taken from it have either gone in different direction or stopped me out
2023-12-06 13:46:35 Me too
2023-12-06 13:47:35 Smtime does the complete opposite
2023-12-06 13:47:35 .09 is pretty high. I did a trade for gold at .1 And lost 160 only bc I didn't let it ride but it's pretty expensive if not using correct lot sizes.
2023-12-06 13:48:35 Yea I took a trade on gbpchf just to test it when my own analysis came out to sell on it and gbp jpy
2023-12-06 13:50:35 I kinda want to do the opposite at times. Lol
2023-12-06 13:51:35 If u do the opposite w a gr lot size  and get out quick u can make some money
2023-12-06 13:51:35 Risky tho
2023-12-06 13:54:33 Yea I rather just stick to a top down analysis
2023-12-06 13:54:33 No need to guess we want to live to trade another day
2023-12-06 13:56:33 Yes true. I wont do it just seem like every trade starts in the other direction and reaches my sl before i can make profit
2023-12-06 13:58:35 If it eventually goes the way you want have you considered moving your sl I mean it doesn’t have to follow what they have given I did that this morning on the u/cad signal
2023-12-06 13:58:35 It has nothing to do with the lot size. They closed my trade almost 10 PIPs after my SL. My SL was set at 2023. They closed my trade at 2032.35. I could put the lot size at .01 and it wouldn’t matter if my trade doesn’t close when it’s supposed to.
2023-12-06 14:00:35 Lot sizes depend on how much you make and lose. But you get that. Sorry to hear that you're having troubles.
2023-12-06 14:00:35 I hv to gv tht a try. Thought of tht just never done it
2023-12-06 14:01:35 I agree
2023-12-06 14:06:36 Ønsk Susanne velkommen i det norske teamet💸❤️
2023-12-06 14:07:23 Velkommen!!
2023-12-06 14:08:35 So you have to remember that your trade is also like an order it can depend on when it was filled yes they should take you out where you have placed
2023-12-06 14:10:35 I’m not understanding what you’re trying to say.
2023-12-06 14:12:35 News
2023-12-06 14:12:35 This most likely happened bc of news. Your SL will be ignored if you trade during those times
2023-12-06 14:13:13 I highly doubt they will screw you over knowing many of us are switching over to them
2023-12-06 14:13:35 Since when? In over 2000 trades I have NEVER had a SL ignored.
2023-12-06 14:13:35 Since ever. It's very well known thing
2023-12-06 14:14:35 You risk your sl being ignored when trading during news. It's a risk you treasure
2023-12-06 14:14:35 It’s like going through a drive thru so you’re not the only person that wants McDonald’s so there’s a probably a million other people who have their SL set there so there might be a delay and like Briana confirmed delay could have been tied to news but idc what you trade you’re technically placing an order with a broker and they gave to fill that request
2023-12-06 14:15:35 I watched my sl jumped the one and ONLY time I traded during news.
2023-12-06 14:15:35 Again in over 2000 trades I have never had a SL ignored. Whether it was a swing trade, day trade or position.
2023-12-06 14:15:35 The news my guy. It happens to the best of us
2023-12-06 14:15:35 It wasn’t ignored it was filled
2023-12-06 14:16:07 It was closed 10 Pips after it was supposed to.
2023-12-06 14:16:07 It jumps over it. Not "ignored" per se. I guess that's the wrong word to use here
2023-12-06 14:16:35 My manara is not working
2023-12-06 14:16:35 That's my point
2023-12-06 14:16:35 Have you tried refreshing or resetting
2023-12-06 14:17:35 Yes been trying that
2023-12-06 14:17:35 Notifications are blank
2023-12-06 14:17:35 In your telegram or on desktop ?
2023-12-06 14:17:35 Desktop
2023-12-06 14:18:35 I got no signals today tho
2023-12-06 14:18:35 I got yesterday
2023-12-06 14:18:35 That doesn’t make sense to me. I swing trade I don’t really day trade and my trades run through the news all the time. I’ve had plenty close because of the news but I’ve never had one skip the SL

2023-12-06 14:18:35 Ok
2023-12-06 14:19:35 Velkommen🤩🤩
2023-12-06 14:19:35 Compare brokers
2023-12-06 14:19:35 Yeah that’s the point. I didn’t have this problem with my old broker.
2023-12-06 14:19:35 There goes your answer
2023-12-06 14:19:46 Velkommen
2023-12-06 14:20:36 Just compare brokers to see if you’re getting same results on trade
2023-12-06 14:21:36 Again that’s the point. I didn’t have this problem with my old broker. Which is why I asked if anyone else had this problem because I just moved to them yesterday.
2023-12-06 14:21:36 Sooo what are you going to do ?
2023-12-06 14:22:36 Still not working
2023-12-06 14:22:36 I’m just going to go back to my old broker. I already contacted support and they told me it shouldn’t have happened and opened a ticket. I wasn’t looking for a why this happened, I just wanted to know if anyone else had this issue.
2023-12-06 14:22:36 Ok glad they helped
2023-12-06 14:23:53 Velkommen ❤️
2023-12-06 14:24:23 Velkommen❤️
2023-12-06 14:41:43 Velkommen❤️
2023-12-06 14:48:36 I would try restarting your computer and contact support ofc
2023-12-06 14:59:36 True which is why they always recommend removing your SL during news or just not trading at all.
2023-12-06 15:03:36 It’s just strange that the “regulated” broker would do that. Kinda got me curious now as I do also have finesse.
2023-12-06 15:11:34 Removing your SL could blow your account during the news. And as far as not trading at all, I swing trade. It’s impossible for my trades not to run through the news.
2023-12-06 15:23:36 Have you asked them to compensate
2023-12-06 15:24:47 Velkommen❤️
2023-12-06 15:39:33 Waiting to hear back from them
2023-12-06 15:40:37 They should do
2023-12-06 15:43:13 It can blow your account which is why they only recommend those do it that can sit there and monitor it during news. Hope you get back your funds man.
2023-12-06 15:50:37 I have had it happen before where my SL or even a TP was missed….espically with a fast moving pair or gold.   If news comes out and it rips it can tend to miss.  Happened with Oanda, HugosWay and Masari over the years.  It’s rare and I don’t think I ever had 10 pips but has happened.  Again noticed it happened with news and spreads
2023-12-06 15:52:37 Not yet, where are those located please?
2023-12-06 15:52:37 Yes, ok. Thank you
2023-12-06 15:53:37 Hey, sometime you have to launch it from main EA back office page again. Hope it works :)
2023-12-06 15:54:33 Where can you find Ralph’s educational videos on manara please?
2023-12-06 16:06:37 Buy/sell zones and RSI cross.   Of all the Manera signals that come, I found maybe 1 in 30 are some what valid and it could be more than a week before an okay signal came over.   Of the okay signals maybe 1/2 had any profits and of the profitable ones maybe 2 or 3 would barley hit TP1
2023-12-06 16:07:37 Thank you Shawn, I’ll test zones and rsi 😊
2023-12-06 16:08:37 Ralph will show the buy/sell zones with an MA cross or something.   Others have talked about an RSI cross.  You need to look at several and decide what works for you.
2023-12-06 16:09:33 When you see them in reviewing charts they are pretty obvious however in real time they can be tricky to pick up
2023-12-06 16:26:35 HELP ME WELCOME NEW MEMBER FROM LITHUANIA!🤍
2023-12-06 16:29:37 Okay I’ve been out of it since mt4 wasn’t going to be expected to continue working and we were headed towards mt5. But looks like Christina sent us to finesse. Is this my new broker?

2023-12-06 18:32:40 The chats will however ALWAYS be talking about xauusd
2023-12-06 18:33:40 Interesting. Why is that? Does no one trade the other pairs?
2023-12-06 18:34:40 Speaking strictly expert chats and gold,  no. They always refer to xauusd.
2023-12-06 18:34:40 I couldn't tell you why. I've been here since Nov and it's always that
2023-12-06 18:35:40 hey everyone!! welcome my girl Beatriz from Portugal!!! U got this girl!!🔥💓

2023-12-06 19:36:00 HELLO HELLO EMPIRE FAMILY 😊

If you are trying to personally message Leona, she is currently traveling right now so she might not be able to message you back ASAP. 

She will however get back to messages as soon as she is back home 🙌🏾

Please be patient ! 

Janae, Leona’s Assistant
2023-12-06 19:48:52 Velkommen
2023-12-06 19:54:41 Yes same here. Apparently this week the market is a bit volatile because of the USA unemployment rate coming out on Friday (NFP), so a little chart analysis is needed before taking any manara alerts and do small lot sizes if you do
2023-12-07 09:10:24 close +10pips
2023-12-07 09:10:24 +20pips close some profits
2023-12-07 09:10:25 anybody know why ive made more than 2€ in my one trade and its only saying ive made less than the two add up?
2023-12-07 09:10:25 maybe swap?
2023-12-07 09:10:25 what am i swapping?
2023-12-07 09:10:25 press on the trade for details
2023-12-07 09:10:25 there it should show you swap charges
2023-12-07 09:10:25 what are the swap charges that’s exactly what it is but what does that mean?
2023-12-07 09:10:25 i cant explain it exactly but it has to do with spreads
2023-12-07 09:10:25 like if spreads were lower when you entered the trade than now i think they charge you more
2023-12-07 09:10:25 something like that
2023-12-07 09:10:25 fair confusing
2023-12-07 09:10:25 and the other way around too, if spreads were wider in the beginning than now you get extra swap
2023-12-07 09:10:25 find that so weird
2023-12-07 09:10:25 yes i dont fully understand it either, but i bet you can find out a lot about it if you google or ask chatgpt
2023-12-07 09:10:25 ive been trading around a month and only finding out about it now😂
2023-12-07 09:10:25 yeah i think thats normal, took me about that time aswell
2023-12-07 09:10:25 It’s been over 24 hours, mt4/5 is still isn’t pulling the hankotrade and herofx broker on the app
2023-12-07 09:10:25 This has been going on for a week now if you have a demo account setup already it will still work! Just be patient they are working through the issue I know that it sucks but it will all work out
2023-12-07 09:10:25 
2023-12-07 09:10:25 UPDATE ON METATRADER 4 & 5 ISSUES ‼️
2023-12-07 09:10:25 TEAM PLEASE BE READING THIS CHAT FOR UPDATES ‼️ 

If you personally message me for certain things, I know you did not read this chat! This is what the chat is created for. So please PIN this chat in your telegram so you never miss an update !

We are only in control of so many things. This issue with the broker WILL PASS. Just be patient please 🙏🏾 This is a minor setback for a major comeback. Once MT4/MT5 and Hankotrade fix this issue, we will then be able to trade again 🤞🏾 

I appreciate everyone who is being extremely patient as we are currently working on this. 

We will be updating everyone here on a daily basis on the status of MT4.
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Please warmly welcome our new member, Peter 🇦🇺
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Welcome to the team Peter. 🤗
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Welcome, Peter
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Chart analysis is need for EVERY trade.  Even if it’s just to look to see if it’s an up trend or down
2023-12-07 09:10:25 I see trades on Manara that say buy but are actually caught in sell. Almost did one and saw it was in entry, got all excited then saw it was in sell but manara says a buy. glad im watching ralph
2023-12-07 09:10:25 🫶🏻🤍
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Found that happening ALOT.  So much that out of 30 alerts maybe 2-3 were worth additional follow up and maybe 1 might have been worth taking.  This was over the course of about 2 weeks.     Thankful for the Manera, but it’s tough to spend the money on the program with no results ya know
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Think of it this way, the monthly subscription you’re spending is also getting you access to learn from the best like Ralph and trade for long term growth ☺️ Then you’ll get more confidence using the manara trades too. Still a good investment on the bright side ☺️
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Quick question 
What time does it open this market open on vantage broker XAU/USD ?
It close just now at 5:28
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Everyone help me welcome Chuelo Lo!🔥
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Welcome ! ❤️
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Happy to have you here!
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Welcome fam!! 🥳
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Quick question 
What time does it open this market open on vantage broker XAU/USD ?
It close just now at 5:28
2023-12-07 09:10:25 The only market open now is Sydney which may be why?. I use this website to help me determine market hours and timezones which Ralph recommended as well in a training sesh: forex.timezoneconverter.com
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Anyone got update on manara?
2023-12-07 09:10:25 /
2023-12-07 09:10:25 I have not been receiving signals and this is the way manara opens in my browsers. Tried 4 different pc, ipad and iphone
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Used chrome browser and safari. Nothing
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Strange mine doing the same too
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Been like this since sunday
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Weird very
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Try clicking monitor under this 3 lines. Mine looks the same
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Are you near resubscription?
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Mine is working ok, are you accessing it via the Eaconomy website?
2023-12-07 09:10:25 I just retried again on another desktop and its working
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Just need to wait now and see if i get signals
2023-12-07 09:10:25 I reconnected the telegram bot
2023-12-07 09:10:25 My manara is doing the same things and had been like that for a while
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Click on notifications to refresh it as well.
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Not yet
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Can everyone please welcome my girls Evita🇱🇹 and Kylah🇦🇺 to the fam
2023-12-07 09:10:25 
2023-12-07 09:10:25 I was clicking notifications so I can get them from manara and my notifications still won’t pop up
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Let your mentor know as well. They may know if there’s an update. If you’ve closed it and gone through Eaconomy to access it again, that may help otherwise definitely let your mentor or Eaconomy know 🌻
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Welcome to the fam!! 🥳
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Oh I’m aware but it also as to be sustainable too
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Thank you for the information I will do that
2023-12-07 09:10:25 What are you struggling to see results with?
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Not struggling.   Just pointing out how many “bad” trades Manera was putting out and following a trade plan.   Hard to hit that 2% a day when the signals are junk
2023-12-07 09:10:25 And nothing worth taking comes for days or weeks
2023-12-07 09:10:25 The signals aren’t junk, it’s just about knowing which ones to take. Not all of Manara’s trades are going to win but what has helped me is watching Ralph’s recordings which is under ‘forex and Manara training’. He explains really well which Manara trades look good to take and other basics about Manara. Definitely suggest looking into it 😊
2023-12-07 09:10:25 I’m well aware of this.  I’m not new.  I have and do follow Ralph’s lessons and that’s why the trades seem junky.  Manera will send a buy in Ralph’s sell zone or inside the RSI without a cross.   There was a stretch of 24 trades where not a single one fell within the rules.  Another time was nearly 2 weeks before a reasonable trade came out.
2023-12-07 09:10:25 How i win with manara is pickup up potentials on 1h and 4h timesframe and scaling down to smaller timeframe following big scale trend directions
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Markout major support and resitance and take trades on smaller timeframes following manara signal

2023-12-07 09:10:25 For Ralphs Channel, when his alerts come in are those trades, day trade or swing trade alerts?
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Same with Ploutos Channel?
2023-12-07 09:10:25 I think it depends on the trade and the chart he is looking at at the time.   I know when I was with him for a few weeks there was only 1 trade alerted (by another member) that was taken and profitable
2023-12-07 09:10:25 Ok. Thank you
