2023-12-08 10:37:05 
2023-12-08 10:38:05 This is MetaTrader 5… what is deviation and am I supposed to leave that blank or put zero when placing a trade.
2023-12-08 10:39:06 Also, is instant execution the same as in MT4’s market execution
2023-12-08 10:40:05 Yes
2023-12-08 10:40:05 Just switched over to MT5 today…
2023-12-08 10:40:05 Yes sgree
2023-12-08 10:40:05 And what about deviation?
2023-12-08 10:41:05 I don’t think mt5 has tht
2023-12-08 11:30:06 In MetaTrader 5, deviation refers to the maximum difference allowed between the requested price and the executed price when placing a trade. If you want to place a trade without any deviation, you can leave it blank or put zero. As for instant execution, it is similar to market execution in MT4. It means that your trade will be executed at the best available price in the market at that moment. Hope that helps clarify things for you📈
2023-12-08 11:31:06 Alyssa👆🏻
2023-12-08 11:37:06 Okay need to ask a question which I don’t understand when place trades on mt4
2023-12-08 11:38:06 If I see this how do I put it on the mt4 because I know how to copy but don’t understand the concept how to place like that way in
2023-12-08 11:39:06 The mt4
2023-12-08 11:50:07 The entry price is 2030. So check the current price to see that it's at the price or very close. This was done on a android. Was looking for a video to explain it.
2023-12-08 12:25:16 NFP in 5 minutes now. Stay tuned!
2023-12-08 12:29:47 Silver chart of yesterday. Will start searching for opportunities on XAGUSD
2023-12-08 12:32:24 I'm sorry NFP in 1 hour. Mistaken with my watch
2023-12-08 12:49:48 is the NFP today?
2023-12-08 12:50:08 Yes
2023-12-08 12:50:36 Yes
2023-12-08 12:51:32 and is it only the USD pairs??
2023-12-08 12:51:40 can we trade with other pairs?

2023-12-08 13:47:25 has anyone seen the gold chart it just DROPPED all the way down to 2014 so quick😳
2023-12-08 13:59:36 Has anyone had a problem with Eaconomy double charging them the monthly fee for the month? I already contacted the support team about it. Just wanted to know if it was common or not.
2023-12-08 14:06:09 Welcome to the team Maggie. 🤗
2023-12-08 14:07:11 +80 ✅
2023-12-08 14:16:15 As for your vote guys: I am with the 55% of you ☺️ I see Gold 1950 as swing. Wait for big future profits when selling. Guys next quiz I want higher correct answers 😁😁
2023-12-08 14:25:09 Okay so how does it insert in the mt4 is a case where I put thd stop loosing and take profit within market execution?
2023-12-08 14:33:05 What ?
2023-12-08 14:39:09 This
2023-12-08 14:47:09 This have 1 stop loss of 2040 and 3 different areas/points to TP. Choose 1 tp for the trade or u can do 3 different positions for each TP....using proper risk management ocourse. If that's what ur asking
2023-12-08 14:49:09 Okay but I saying thou how do input this stop loss and to in the mt4 because when I do enter in it’s not taking the execution I was wondering if it’s the case I was doing it wrong at the time
2023-12-08 14:52:09 I think there is a video in ECA that better explains
2023-12-08 14:53:09 Go to gold and put in a sell trade, then go back to the gold trade under trade tab then click on gold, modify it then out sl and tp in. SL has to be 2045 and tp can be example 2007
2023-12-08 14:57:09 Okay thanks but is it the case when I see a sell or a buy trade I use market execution if there is not entry price limit only Sl and Tp ?
2023-12-08 14:58:54 Correct. Market Execution is where you enter the trade at that moment. Pick your lot size then pick buy/sell then go back and modify your trade, thats where you enter your SL and TP. Fast way of getting in a trade when they say to. Make more money that way.
2023-12-08 14:58:58

2023-12-08 15:33:05 Ok so you'll have to login to your finesse account, go to withdraw, hit bitcoin then follow instructions. Then once to your cashapp account, you'll have to sell that bitcoin to usd.

2023-12-08 17:14:36 Me too please
2023-12-08 17:14:36 So an update on my issues with FinesseFX. They closed 3 of my trades past S/L. 2 of them 10 PIPs past my S/L, and one of them 100 PIPs past S/L. And no 2/3 were not during news. I've been waiting 3 days for someone to get back to me and nothing. I will try to contact support again today. I hope no one else has had these issues.
2023-12-08 17:15:28 I’m still new to all this & in the process of getting everything together.
