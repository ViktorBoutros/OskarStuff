2023-11-24 03:20:22 Welcome
2023-11-24 03:22:22 How do you indicate that a currency is not good to trade at forex factory
2023-11-24 03:23:22 When the folder near it is red, from what I’ve learned but could be more to it.
2023-11-24 03:25:22 Red folders are a no
2023-11-24 03:25:22 Ook!!
So when the folder is red it should not be traded with or against any other currency
2023-11-24 03:26:22 Correct!
2023-11-24 03:26:22 Anyone know how to add Bitcoin from cash app to my HankoTrade balance?
2023-11-24 03:27:22 what if manara gives a signal for a currency, but it has a red folder, is it best to not take the trade?
2023-11-24 03:33:22 Yes and it’s not that you can’t take the trade, it’s solely up to you but it’s advised not to cause it’s very risky.

2023-11-24 03:53:23 As a beginner how many trades should I be taking per day and what lot size should i start with??
2023-11-24 03:59:22 0.01 lot size, 0.01 per $100 dollars…start with a demo account if you haven’t until you feel comfortable going with a live account.
2023-11-24 04:00:22 Anyone having issues with the course videos  they are not playing for me
2023-11-24 04:02:22 Ook cool👍🏾

2023-11-24 04:29:22 you would have to deposit money to your broker
2023-11-24 04:29:22 they would open it for you
2023-11-24 04:35:22 Broker?
2023-11-24 06:14:24 Welcome Ashlee to the team 🇦🇺 She’s excited to be here!!
2023-11-24 06:27:06 Yes.  You need a broker to deposit money to in order to start trading either live or demo

You send them money and once cleared start trading
2023-11-24 06:31:24 What broker do you recommend for a beginner?
2023-11-24 06:31:24 And what is the minimum amount to dept?
2023-11-24 06:31:24 Deposit
2023-11-24 06:32:24 Your broker depends on whatever country you’re in as well.
2023-11-24 06:33:24 O need help with this
2023-11-24 06:37:25 Broker is dependent on where you are and what you’re looking to trade.   Deposit amount is how much you can afford 

You should talk to your mentor or who told you about this.  There is a whole start up process
2023-11-24 06:37:25 Buy bitcoin on your cashapp, and to send bitcoin copy and paste the bitcoin wallet address from your hankotrade website into the cashapp. It should hit your account in less than 30 mins
2023-11-24 06:53:25 What country are you in?

2023-11-24 11:04:31 Hello everyone. As you have all noticed: this week there is no liquidity and the market is very slow + today is Thanksgiving in the United States (holiday). We placed very few signals this week because no clear directions and also no strong opportunities! We have to trade with the market accordingly, hence we should not risk it whenever the situation is uncertain. We follow up our open trades in order to update them but we are not to place any new signal.

2023-11-24 12:29:29 Thought I was the only one with that issue. Also tried refreshing it
2023-11-24 13:06:29 I have the same issue, manará it’s not sending me notifications
2023-11-24 13:12:29 You  tried on computer?
2023-11-24 13:12:29 Check your settings perhaps, I have mine set to complete and just a few patterns and I didn't get any notification yesterday but when I check the notification settings in manara, I saw that there were trades but all incomplete
2023-11-24 13:12:29 Hence I didn't receive because none were complete
2023-11-24 13:18:29 I had the same issue with Manara and contacted support and they fixed it for me.
2023-11-24 13:26:30 My broker only uses meta-trader five and there’s issues with invalid accounts what I need is a new broker and a new platform to trade. Any suggestions I’m in the United States.
2023-11-24 13:43:28 Trade closed @ TP1 👉 Price at entry again
2023-11-24 14:17:30 No, only my phone
2023-11-24 14:17:30 Will do that, thank you
2023-11-24 14:45:31 Which broker
2023-11-24 17:43:12 Does anyone know if I can withdraw money from my live account?
2023-11-24 17:43:33 Or does it depend on the broker
2023-11-24 17:46:33 If YOU Are verified YOU can yeah
2023-11-24 17:50:33 Sway markets
2023-11-24 17:51:16 Yes
2023-11-24 18:51:16 Isn’t that the point ?
2023-11-24 18:51:34 A lot of folks use Marsari however only the desktop supports MT4
2023-11-24 18:52:34 Never heard of them
2023-11-24 18:53:34 I only know of Marsari and HugosWay.   KOT4X is another but not on the MT platform I guess anymore
