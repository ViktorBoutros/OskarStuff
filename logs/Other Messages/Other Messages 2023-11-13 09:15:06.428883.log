2023-11-13 11:32:09 I typed the server
2023-11-13 11:32:09 And it didnt show anything
2023-11-13 11:33:09 I typed it in and pressed ok

2023-11-13 11:33:09

2023-11-13 11:34:09 You need go to email and there you will find all data for login into your account including server and password.
2023-11-13 11:35:09 Hey, I just wanted to ask how can we effectively use Manara to determine whether we’re supposed to buy or sell, based on the patterns?
2023-11-13 11:36:09 I experience the same.
2023-11-13 11:41:09 You have in back office Eca -> click the link kearneca.com -> use your loging for eaconomy -> Forex & Manara Training. There is explaning everything, just go through videos.

2023-11-13 12:04:09 
2023-11-13 12:05:09 It shows me these 3 when i search VantageInternational-Live 16
2023-11-13 12:07:10 I don't know for MT5,but I think VantageInternational-Live16 is for MT4.Because I use MT4 and on MT4 is a lot of servers.
2023-11-13 12:07:26 I tried on both
2023-11-13 12:08:09 Can you show on your pc ?
2023-11-13 12:10:09 I use on my android phone. I don't use computer version.
2023-11-13 12:15:08 I am talking about pc version not phone bro
2023-11-13 12:19:09 It must be the same.

Did you try MT4 pc version and find your server?
2023-11-13 12:20:09 It doesnt show on  mt4/5 the server that i need
2023-11-13 12:20:09 Only those three
2023-11-13 12:22:03 It just keeps circeling
2023-11-13 12:22:03 Doesnt show anything on the journal that profile invalid or something

2023-11-13 13:26:19 Hei, muligens litt merkelig spørsmål men prøver meg uansett. Jeg er veldig ny her, og har tenkt å notere meg nyttig info. Alt fra korte forklaringer om for eksempel pips, take profit, stop loss etc. Har også lyst å notere om trafing «grafer» og hva om lønner seg osv. Derfor lurer jeg på: er det noen som har noe form for notater de ønsker å dele meg meg? Kan væra alt mulig, så lenge det er noe jeg får bruk for en gang. Ta gjerne kontakt! På forhånd takk😃🫶🏼

2023-11-13 14:56:26 He always sends a link in the chat like an hour before the session

2023-11-13 15:02:12 What the hell is wrong with you?? You should be banned
2023-11-13 15:02:13 i agree, that is not tolerated here
2023-11-13 15:02:36 He should be banned on this group.
2023-11-13 15:02:57 Yeah that’s really not on
2023-11-13 15:03:12 Deleted the messages now too hasnt he
2023-11-13 15:04:13 yep
2023-11-13 15:04:13 So when Abdallah was talking about executing trades so fast, how did he find that? What's it called ?:) If anyone knows the answer that would help me out tremendously thank you
2023-11-13 15:04:13 He showed us in the live session today, but I've seemed to had missed where to find
2023-11-13 15:04:13 okay so
2023-11-13 15:05:12 you go on the arabic telegram channel
2023-11-13 15:05:12 if you’re using MT4 I just depth of market to quickly enter and exit
2023-11-13 15:05:12 I have mt5 I'll see if I see that there,
2023-11-13 15:05:12 and then one of the pinned messages is called something like „weekly pair trading + scalping“ (im paraphrasing) and in the second half of the video he explains it
2023-11-13 15:06:12 mt5 has it too
2023-11-13 15:06:12 Perfect thanks so much!:)
2023-11-13 15:07:12 Anyone have any recommendations for a broker for Canada for his scalping sessions ? I'm finding the one I'm using to have a pretty high spread

2023-11-13 15:28:14 Hi has anyone ever experienced a problem with their live mt4 account? I accidentally logged out and now when I log back in it just does this for a really long time
2023-11-13 15:28:14 
2023-11-13 15:32:13 Then it signs me out.
2023-11-13 15:35:58 Hey that sounds frustrating. I’m sorry you’re having that problem. I’ve never encountered it myself. Is it possible that your app needs an update?
2023-11-13 15:37:13 It’s so frustrating I’m close to tears… I have tried literally everything and there is no support which is inane.
2023-11-13 15:37:13 Insane *
2023-11-13 15:38:13 
2023-11-13 15:43:13 I’m sorry. There’s got to be a solution though. Like Fatima said, maybe try mt5. The transfer process should be really easy.
2023-11-13 15:46:13 Thank you! I appreciate the response from you both. Do you use mt5?
2023-11-13 15:49:13 Your welcome! 🫶🏼🤍
I use mt4 because I haven’t had any problems with it yet. I’m thinking maybe it’s a good idea to make the switch now though.
2023-11-13 15:53:13 I also wanted to switch to mt5 but it doesn’t support neither of my brokers at the moment
2023-11-13 16:02:13 Uninstall it, and install again. It could be solution.
2023-11-13 16:02:13 Thank you, but unfortunately I’ve already tried that along with everything else I could think of.
2023-11-13 16:03:37 TP2 💥💥💥💥
2023-11-13 16:05:04 Had this issue with mines yesterday but fortunately it fixed itself.
2023-11-13 16:06:13 These signals from manara trade ideas and sessions do they last more than one day? Or they can be used only that day when they’re sent?
2023-11-13 16:08:14 Damn lucky! Lol. I will just try to email my broker and get help! I really appreciate your guys help 🥹🫶🏼
2023-11-13 16:09:13 don’t ever do old trade signals
2023-11-13 16:14:13 
2023-11-13 16:16:14 Rightt. Like you could go Look at an old expired trade and think that you can enter it because maybe the market is at the entry point. But if it’s a later time, and that trade idea has surpassed its time frame, then you will have missed the actual trade analysis. And you will end up entering when the market is now moving in a different direction.
2023-11-13 16:17:13 thank you so much❤️
2023-11-13 16:19:18 +80 ✅ Book
2023-11-13 16:22:01 Ikke merkelig spørsmål i det hele tatt! Gjerne videresend til meg også om du fikk noen svar❤️
2023-11-13 16:22:15 I need to get my manara notifications set back up again. So I can’t remember if the notifications tell whether they are complete, incomplete, or expired. But I know it tells you from the list of ideas coming from the manara browser. And it’s very helpful to know
2023-11-13 16:25:14 Have to reset it to only send notifications with complete analysis only from the pairs you want to execute in the live market

2023-11-13 17:05:15 will look it up. Thank you! 🫶🏼
2023-11-13 17:07:29 I second that, switched from masari to KOT4X, best decision I’ve made and the spreads are better imo.
2023-11-13 17:09:05 Välkommen 🤗
2023-11-13 17:09:05 Dang that is going to help so much. Thank you for your help!😊

2023-11-13 18:15:40 😍😍
2023-11-13 18:26:16 Why is masari capital unsafe for the US? So should I switch to KOT4X, since im in the US?
2023-11-13 18:27:07 
2023-11-13 18:27:23 Finner ikke dette skjema i gruppene, noen som kan sende det?🫶🏼

2023-11-13 18:28:51 I would like to know to please, I am also using Masari .

2023-11-13 18:34:40 KOT4x is the best option for US members.
2023-11-13 18:35:16 Same! Me too
2023-11-13 18:38:16 whats for eu scalp ?
2023-11-13 18:38:16 vantage raw ?
2023-11-13 18:39:16 😂
2023-11-13 18:53:17 I just got Masari should I switch too? Sorry new here and just want the best options. Thanks in advance
2023-11-13 18:56:17 I never knew it was unsafe honestly, I switched based off of good reviews on KOT4X and recommendations. Maybe masari isn’t regulated or something but I don’t know if KOT4X is even regulated to be honest but it’s been treating me good since I’ve had it.

2023-11-13 19:26:57 Hey Guys I have been practicing on MT4 and this is what my profit looks like today…. I’m ready to go live. What are my next steps? I just was playing around but I really like the outcome.
2023-11-13 19:27:34 The links for this have expired it looks like, is there any way to access the 200k strategy?
2023-11-13 19:28:17 Crazy thing 🥹
2023-11-13 19:29:17 Reduce your lot size, it’s WAY too high. Start smaller and then work your way up.
At least that’s what I was taught by my mentor.
2023-11-13 19:30:18 Yes of course. This is just the prop app and for fun to see what potentially my profit will look like. I’m super new to this so thank you.
