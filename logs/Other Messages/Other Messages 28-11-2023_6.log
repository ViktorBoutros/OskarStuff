2023-11-28 06:32:50 Correct cause the M5/M15 timeframe is what scalpers use since they enter and exits trades quick, whereas the H4 timeframe is what day traders use cause they enter the trade and hold their positions longer.
2023-11-28 06:48:50 -erfect. Thx for the advice
2023-11-28 07:34:50 Yes v the shorter timeframe may be more for scalpers.   I trade can take 2-3 days to come through.    Don’t go be the time Frank
2023-11-28 07:35:50 Frame
2023-11-28 07:45:16 What’s the difference between Metatrader 4 to Metatrader 5 and which one is the best option to use
2023-11-28 08:38:12 MT4 is for automatic trading that you can link eacho, MT5 is manual trading
2023-11-28 08:39:09 Thank you 🙏
2023-11-28 08:56:16 Metatrader 4 and 5 are very similar actually , 5 is just a bit more updated . You are more than welcome to manually trade with either or . Unless you have eacho like Sara metioned it’s recommended to use mt4 for EACHO and mt5 for manual trading .
2023-11-28 09:04:51 is there a way for me to switch teams or learn under someone else ?
2023-11-28 09:11:11 What is EACHO?
2023-11-28 09:13:00 Is that an additional package you can order?
2023-11-28 09:13:51 you want to change mentor?
2023-11-28 09:13:51 yes
2023-11-28 09:15:18 yes😌 its an ai that trades for you, launched ab a week ago
2023-11-28 09:15:18 add me as contact
2023-11-28 09:20:38 Thank you so much 💕
2023-11-28 09:20:38 correct, except what the timeframes indicate isnt how quickly to get into the trade, it means how much time one candle stick is worth
2023-11-28 09:20:53 Thank you so much 💕
2023-11-28 09:20:53 so on the M5 every candle represents 5 mins of price action whereas on the H1 every candle represents one hour of price action
2023-11-28 09:37:52 Guys , is the eca working for y’all? I can login myself normally in the eaconomy site and when I try to open eca for the backvideos it says my password is incorrect and when I try to change it , it says no account found under my email … which doesn’t make any sense at all because I can still login etc
2023-11-28 09:42:44 Hi Team- are you getting the deposit bonus from HankoTrade?
2023-11-28 10:19:52 Is the website still undergoing fixes?
2023-11-28 10:19:52 Eca^
2023-11-28 10:24:52 No it’s working again
2023-11-28 10:30:53 How do u know wht time frame a trade last or should last ?
2023-11-28 10:47:53 It’s called trade management you should risk no more than 5 percent on every trade so the bigger the stop loss they give out the smaller lot size you wanna use and honestly to be safe if you cash out after 10 -20 pips and don’t get greedy you will have more profit trade but you may miss out on a big move but it’s honestly way safer
2023-11-28 11:14:53 hey everyone i was just getting started with onboarding but none of the video links work for me. does anyone know why? or somewhere else i can access them? 🥲
2023-11-28 11:16:05 Is Hanko available now on Eacho?
2023-11-28 11:45:58 Hei folkens! 
Skulle vi hatt en teamcall i nærmeste fremtid, catche up og hilse på de nye🩷✨
2023-11-28 11:46:29 Do we need a laptop to trade with Eacho?
2023-11-28 11:47:43 Jaaa godt insh Rikke🫶🏽jeg er med🤩

2023-11-28 11:49:50 20 tiden er perfekt
2023-11-28 11:52:53 Hi everyone, is anyone else having trouble with the Eca? I can't see the videos and the page layout is off, it won't let me see the menu options on the left
2023-11-28 11:52:53 is anyone else having trouble with eca? 
I can't see the menu and the videos are disorganized
2023-11-28 12:01:51 I see all fine and organized.

Try close this window and go back to back office and reopen ECA again. That I do when I can't log-in and tell me email or password is wrong. Then when I reopen eca from back office all was fine.
2023-11-28 12:09:54 Hey, is anyone else having trouble accessing eca and the back office?
2023-11-28 12:11:54 I did, but it still doesn't work, are you using Google Chrome?
2023-11-28 12:13:54 No, I use firefox.
2023-11-28 12:14:54 I'll try with Firefox just in case
2023-11-28 12:37:54 Good morning didn’t yall receive a email saying it would be under maintenance?
2023-11-28 12:38:54 I think it worked, but for example I click on on Manara and it only allows me to see one video, not the whole list
😔
2023-11-28 12:40:54 I did but it said that it would be ready in 24 hours and I got it on Saturday, are you by any chance having the same issues I am?
2023-11-28 12:54:54 This happens to me to, I still have not been able to access ECA and I've tried everything
2023-11-28 12:54:54 Press past weekley sessions. That worked for me
2023-11-28 13:01:51 have you tried using a different browser or entering in incognito mode
2023-11-28 13:02:54 Yeh and support have not got back to me
2023-11-28 13:03:54 Thanks, it did load the videos but not all of them, the latest sessions aren't loading for example for Ralph's sessions
2023-11-28 13:03:54 I'll try live chat again but I always miss them when they are open because of the time zone
2023-11-28 13:04:54 same here, my live chat is closed right now, but I did send an email to support@eaconomy.com
2023-11-28 13:05:54 Yeh I did to, I'd say they have a huge amount of emails to get back to with eacho coming out and the new ECA ect
2023-11-28 13:07:56 Jeg kan ikke idsg kl 20 men kan 19 eller 22😅
2023-11-28 13:08:54 yeah, hopefully they will answer soon
2023-11-28 13:08:54 Hi try this,they changed it
2023-11-28 13:09:54 
2023-11-28 13:10:54 Good morning is 0.01 the best lot size to use on a 5000 demo account
2023-11-28 13:10:54 You mean go through the link or the Forex LTS ect?
2023-11-28 13:11:54 It depends what you plan to start with on a live account because you want to use an appropriate lot size in accordance to what you will start with on a live account
2023-11-28 13:12:54 But for 5000 that lot is to small
2023-11-28 13:12:54 
2023-11-28 13:12:54 But again it's upto you how much you willing to risk
2023-11-28 13:12:54 Yeh but I can't even get to that page
2023-11-28 13:13:54 you can't access your backoffice either then?
2023-11-28 13:14:54 I can but it just looks them same as before, there's no change on mine
2023-11-28 13:14:54 Well on a live account I want to start with $100 dollars so what should be my lot size
2023-11-28 13:14:54 Hmmm,then I don't know,I had problem yesterday aswell
2023-11-28 13:14:54 So for the $5000 demo account I should use a lot size of 1.0
2023-11-28 13:15:54 Oh, ok I didn't realise that the back office had changed aswell
2023-11-28 13:15:54 https://www.cashbackforex.com/tools/position-size-calculator/XAU.USD
2023-11-28 13:15:54 my backoffice looks the same, what I did was open the ECA from the back office
2023-11-28 13:16:51 But essentially it's 0.01 per $100
2023-11-28 13:18:54 Ok thanks
2023-11-28 13:18:54 Use a realistic lot size that u will use for live account so that u can see what profits you could potentially make on a live with that lot size
2023-11-28 13:30:52 Does anyone know what xauusd.HKT .. the HKT part?
2023-11-28 13:31:10 Hankotrade

2023-11-28 13:36:55 
2023-11-28 13:37:08 Has Hanko been added to Eacho yet? Any update?
2023-11-28 13:43:55 Go to orders
2023-11-28 13:43:55 And then go to autoship
2023-11-28 13:44:55 And retry payment

2023-11-28 13:48:00 Kan folk like meldingene nedover for å se hva som passer best da:
2023-11-28 13:48:03 19:00
2023-11-28 13:48:06 20:00
2023-11-28 13:48:29 I don’t have that option for retry payment
2023-11-28 13:48:49 Did you try opened used firefox?
2023-11-28 13:48:55 No actually, I'll try that
2023-11-28 13:50:16 Kan hend det er litt kort varsel og at det er bedre om vi planlegger det bedre om noen dager feks,  så flere får vært med!
2023-11-28 13:51:01 Sant! Jeg kan hver dag, så hvis folk heller skriver dager det passer for de?❤️
2023-11-28 13:51:55 If you go to orders, it should have the order that didn't go through saying "failed" and somewhere on that failed transaction it should have an option to try again
2023-11-28 13:53:55 does anyone know if this is still being updated??it doesn’t have all the videos for forex and manara training🙏🏼🥲
2023-11-28 13:54:55 It only just changed, there probably still working on ironing some things out, give it a few days or so because they can only fix things as they go along when they get feed back ect
2023-11-28 13:54:55 
2023-11-28 13:54:55 
2023-11-28 13:54:55 ok thank you so much:))
2023-11-28 13:55:55 Why are there so many problems and issues

2023-11-28 14:09:29 same happened to me, you will see some more videos if you click on past sessions, but not all of them are there, guess they are still working on updating things
2023-11-28 14:18:55 that’s what i thought i was watching demand and supply videos and i can’t find them there
2023-11-28 14:19:55 i did but it doesn’t yet

2023-11-28 15:05:56 In the other chat from stick options Jess said videos are missing too and this has been communicated to the team, hopefully they will fix it

2023-11-28 16:08:39 GOOD MORNING FAMILY 😍
2023-11-28 16:09:02 Do you guys remember the EURJPY trade we took on lastnight’s call from Manara ?!
2023-11-28 16:09:18 
2023-11-28 16:09:37 WE HIT TAKE PROFIT 🏆
2023-11-28 16:09:49 
2023-11-28 16:10:05 Everyone go checkkkk !!!
2023-11-28 16:10:53 Can I be added too?
2023-11-28 16:14:08 So your lot size for that was 1.0?
2023-11-28 16:14:51 You can have a 1.0 if your account is 1,000 n up
2023-11-28 16:15:35 message your mentor 🙏🏾 i cant add you for some reason
2023-11-28 16:16:19 I would recommend following the lot size sheet 💕
2023-11-28 16:16:50 
2023-11-28 16:17:10 Great! Thank you. So when it says buy 1.00 in blue, that’s the lot size being used ?
2023-11-28 16:18:50 What’s the best app to use to fund our live acct as a newbie!?
2023-11-28 16:18:50 Yes, that is the lot size
2023-11-28 16:18:59 Cashapp if you’re in the US
2023-11-28 16:19:27 Where I circled in green this will be your lot size on what you choose according to the $ you have in your account
2023-11-28 16:19:48 Any specific crypto we should or should or shouldn’t use?
2023-11-28 16:20:45 I always recommend just BTC
2023-11-28 16:21:14 Is there a reason why we can’t use 0.8-1.0 for accounts with less than $1000?
2023-11-28 16:21:46 Thank you!! Im assuming it’s a pretty easy process to fund the acct?!
2023-11-28 16:21:46 Where are you guys getting your signals for gold from? I don’t see them come through the manara chat at all….
2023-11-28 16:22:57

2023-11-28 16:23:00 Could I also be added as well?
2023-11-28 16:23:11 Can I be added to ?
2023-11-28 16:23:34 That’s over leveraging. You can easily blow your account like tht
2023-11-28 16:23:44 Yessss

2023-11-28 16:29:42 Hi! How do we join 1V trade channel?
2023-11-28 16:30:57 I just need to check 
When was the last signal from ploutos?
2023-11-28 16:31:52 I’m apart of that chat but I haven’t received anything today…

2023-11-28 16:33:17 If you are not in the trade channel put a ✋ and admin can add you in xx
2023-11-28 16:33:57 I think that trade was from yesterday because I have it in my chat from yesterday
2023-11-28 16:33:57 Yesterday
2023-11-28 16:35:57 Oh ok, great thank you just had to ask in case there was something wrong on my end.

2023-11-28 16:39:02 Everyone please vote so that admin are aware of who needs to be added xx
2023-11-28 16:40:13 Another question, is there a way to filter for the specific signals of my choice on the manara website instead of seeing literally everything?
2023-11-28 16:43:08 Elsker det Rikke! bra ide
2023-11-28 16:43:40 Just to confirm with fellow Canadians Using Eacho. Do we also have to accept our trades once a day??
2023-11-28 16:48:57 Last trade idea I received from the channel was yesterday morning
2023-11-28 16:49:57 There is. To clarify however, Do you mean for the notifications that it sends you, or from the website browser?
2023-11-28 16:58:58 Notifications that it sends to me
2023-11-28 17:03:43 Sends to me
2023-11-28 17:03:57 Though I haven't seen that browser notification pop up either
2023-11-28 17:23:58 How do I reset my password for manara
2023-11-28 17:31:52 If I remember right you have to set your desired settings from the browser And then reset the Telegram bot. I’ve never done this myself however, So I’m not exactly sure how the process goes
2023-11-28 17:36:17 Velkommen Christina ❤️

2023-11-28 18:23:59 I haven’t been able to view the video for Eacho, and I haven’t seen it on eaconomy website so I don’t even know what the product is about so I haven’t purchased. Would love to learn what it all entails…

2023-11-28 18:50:48 Welcome to the team Eric. 🤗
2023-11-28 18:51:43 Hey welcome 🤗
2023-11-28 18:53:16 yeah that’s weird
2023-11-28 18:53:27 it didn’t hit my SL and we are using same broker
2023-11-28 18:53:37 🫤
2023-11-28 18:53:40 Velkommmmeennn!!!💪🤍
2023-11-28 18:54:06 
2023-11-28 18:54:12 Never hit my SL
2023-11-28 18:54:31 So odd…
2023-11-28 18:54:42 It happens sometimes
2023-11-28 18:54:47 It’s the weirdest thing
2023-11-28 18:54:54 One of the experts also lost the trade
2023-11-28 18:54:58 but 3 of them profited
2023-11-28 18:55:17 and we all have the same SL
2023-11-28 18:57:07 I copied the trade when it came through…we are all at around the same entry amount and have the same stoploss…
2023-11-28 18:57:29 Yes exactly
2023-11-28 18:58:41 Right I have had this happen to me too but hey just remember it’s alright! We have plenty of more trades to come along and we will all still end the week profitable 💕
