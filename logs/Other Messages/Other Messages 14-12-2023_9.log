2023-12-14 09:23:34 Won my largest trade so far. $39.27
2023-12-14 09:38:34 Is anyone still having issues with their payment not processing? mine won’t go through…
2023-12-14 09:43:35 it usually takes 2-5 work days
2023-12-14 09:54:35 Does anyone know how I can change my lot size on meta trader 5 on a demo account ?
2023-12-14 09:57:35 This is from someone sharing his resulta with Eacho in the FB group. So it seems it is working all right 👍
2023-12-14 09:58:35 😍
2023-12-14 09:58:35 I’ll wait for more results until January
2023-12-14 10:12:35 you press on the lot size and type in the appropriate amount
2023-12-14 10:13:35 Oh thank you. I got it 😍😍
2023-12-14 10:58:36 Welcome🫶🏼
2023-12-14 11:12:37 Welcome all newcomers to the team. 🤗
2023-12-14 12:48:37 Can someone add me in the dutch team please?
2023-12-14 14:25:39 Hey guys…could someone please share the news website that was shared in one of the training vids? I thought I bookmarked but can’t seem to find now .Thought I saw someone post a screenshot earlier but can’t find that now either. It’s the site with the red , orange, yellow news folders.

2023-12-14 14:44:39 Thank you!! 🥰
2023-12-14 15:09:40 Minding everybody business except his I bet...no proper risk management....he preaches about not using SL....don't be like him 😂😂
2023-12-14 15:17:40 ?
2023-12-14 15:55:41 
2023-12-14 15:58:40 So called "expert " on gold? Yeah ok... my account is gone. 1000 gone. Removing the sl. Are you fing kidding me. Last time I take an 'experts' advice.
2023-12-14 16:01:40 Who told you to do that? Lol
2023-12-14 16:02:40 You know about risk , use the proper risk managment . 

Noone is 100% expert here . Its has been crazy news YESTERDAY on gold . Its very risky to not have stop loss .
2023-12-14 16:02:40 Ploutos told us to remove sl til today. But whatever all good.
2023-12-14 16:03:40 No one should let out alerts when there is news.
2023-12-14 16:03:40 I took my stop loss off but basically just moved it to the absolute max I was willing to lose… didn’t want to blow my funded account. Still sucks but it’s on us to manage our risk.
2023-12-14 16:03:40 Rather be in small loss than blew account for future 🙌
2023-12-14 16:03:40 I guess it would have to be a very very small lot size with enough funds to cover the swings of the market until it can move back towards take profit
2023-12-14 16:05:36 Probably just not worth it to trade during news though, unless you’re right on the charts monitoring by the second 🤷🏼‍♀️
2023-12-14 16:05:36 Sorry to hear about your losses Nic!
2023-12-14 16:06:40 Nothing I can do about it.
2023-12-14 16:06:40 I appreciate that though
2023-12-14 16:07:40 I usually try to avoid trading on big impact news.
2023-12-14 16:07:40 Sad that this happened to you Nic :(
2023-12-14 16:08:41 
2023-12-14 16:08:41 I understand that but why put out an alert when he knows the news was going on? He's been doing this awhile and he knows how many people take his alerts. But all good. My fault
2023-12-14 16:09:41 
2023-12-14 16:09:41 
2023-12-14 16:11:41 
2023-12-14 16:14:41 He does not have to put any alerts out. He can say no alert today due to the news. Being new I learned a lesson.
2023-12-14 16:17:41 That money will come back ten fold ! ✨
2023-12-14 16:18:41 I actually looked at my trade it's still going on. I'm letting it go. What else can I do
2023-12-14 16:21:15 This energy ! ❣️ Amen💯
2023-12-14 16:22:41 
2023-12-14 16:23:41 I still hope that gold will go down before blew my account,because i didn't make sl. 😔
2023-12-14 16:25:41 Ok. That's your opinion because Ralph went onto his channel and said he's done for the week unless manara says something. So yeah....
2023-12-14 16:25:41 Hell nooo😭😭😭😭😭
2023-12-14 16:26:41 I'll take a pause from Pluto because i'm also a begginer, still learning and yea I also lost trades, not one but few by removing stop loss. So far I also earned money from Pluto, so it's still good to have it in my opinion, just won't be using it until I practice a little more and till the whole news and new year thing passes.
2023-12-14 16:27:41 I think it’s just been these two days so far
2023-12-14 16:27:41 The market is usually predictable in other days
2023-12-14 16:27:41 I know now that everytime need put sl. I'm lucky that is small account.
2023-12-14 16:34:21 GUYSSS , our guy Eric just opened his live act today and has made $108 🔥 congratulations on starting your live act daily goal for today was reached 🫡😮‍💨
2023-12-14 16:43:51 Let go Eric !!!
2023-12-14 16:52:41 Do we have to get the upgraded version of Trading view in order to use SMC?
2023-12-14 16:58:26 
2023-12-14 16:58:26 
2023-12-14 16:58:30 
2023-12-14 17:09:42 Yep this is true he said not to trade yesterday and he also said to chill for the week
2023-12-14 17:14:42 Yeah bro I took mines off but put it back on, I was too nervous fr
2023-12-14 17:19:42 No the upgraded version lets you use more than 2 indicators at a time. With the free version you can only use 2 at a time.
2023-12-14 17:19:42 Hey guys, I just want some feedback from whoever uses Xenia and Aithena. I personally don’t use it but I’m signing up someone who wants to use it and I just want to know your journey/experience with it and how much you started with.
2023-12-14 17:23:33 Yeah my trade is still going. Well my 3. Have to let it ride for now. Can't back out. My fault for removing my sl. Learning experience
2023-12-14 17:30:42 As long as you have enough capital to cover the difference without your trades closing automatically , isn’t it possible that the market could move back in your favor and the trades can become profitable?
2023-12-14 17:42:31 Velkommen Amin 🔥
2023-12-14 17:56:42 
2023-12-14 18:00:42 Oh man yeah, I know. I saw the spike in relation to entry! 😅🫶🏻 looks like it’s coming back down though. Wishing you all the best and I appreciate you breaking things down and sharing your experience along the way!
2023-12-14 18:01:42 Being transparent with losses can be hard. I’m going through the same thing right now. personally feeling like I’ll wait off December for how volatile it is . 
The stress has been too much

2023-12-14 18:10:43 
2023-12-14 18:11:09 Yes! Same 🫶🏻😂
2023-12-14 18:11:09 
2023-12-14 18:11:43 Stop loss is our friend!
2023-12-14 18:26:43 
2023-12-14 18:31:43 Yees,gold coming down. 😊
2023-12-14 18:38:44 does anyone here follow the eminus Ariabic channel? Looking to see if anyone in the US has an off shore broker to trade us 30?
2023-12-14 18:38:44 Im holding
2023-12-14 18:40:43 Me too. I hope it's coming down at least 2017.87 to be on entry.
2023-12-14 18:44:43 
2023-12-14 18:44:43 same. ill let it ride till then
2023-12-14 18:46:43 Yes stop loss, lot size and your own personal amount that you’re willing to not go beyond per trade are all your friend. I had a low lot size so that’s the only reason I took off SL but then also have that risk management number in your head where even with that advice, you won’t let the trade go beyond that $X that you’re willing to risk. All a learning curve and Ralph once said he blew three accounts when he first started because of all the learning curves 🤪 you are persistent and willing to learn Nic so you will make money in trading 🙌🏻 love your never give up attitude despite that experience 🫶🏼
2023-12-14 18:52:44 
2023-12-14 19:09:44 ooooh gold is going down slowly but it's going down at the moment 🙌🏻
2023-12-14 19:27:44 Yeah man sorry this happened to you. You will get it back though 💯
2023-12-14 19:28:44 
2023-12-14 19:29:44 That’s the spirit my guy! 💪🏾💯
2023-12-14 19:34:44 
2023-12-14 19:44:44 💪🏼💪🏼
2023-12-14 20:22:45 Anyone know wtf is going on with Masari Capital?

2023-12-14 21:14:46 Welcome to the team Tiara. 🤗
2023-12-14 21:30:46 Welcome 🙌🏾🔥
2023-12-14 21:54:46 Do we have a new crypto program ?
2023-12-14 21:56:46 I’ve been practicing on demo for 5 days and almost ALL trades are losses. I don’t know why but I want to improve. This makes me nervous to open a live account. Is anyone experiencing the same thing or can give advice?
2023-12-14 21:57:31 Was anyone having trouble with the masari capital when trying to sign up for it??
2023-12-14 21:58:46 It’s under maintenance I think
2023-12-14 21:58:46 Where can I find that?
2023-12-14 22:05:37 It’s on the site when you’re trying to login or sign up, this pops up.
2023-12-14 22:05:38 
2023-12-14 22:06:08 How long did it take for you guys start making money because this signing up process is taking forever
2023-12-14 22:06:46 Thanks
2023-12-14 22:07:46 I use finesse fix for this very reason. Masari has been going through a transition process and it’s been ongoing so I switched my broker
2023-12-14 22:10:46 How can I do that?
2023-12-14 22:11:46 And I can switch to it even though this is the one they recommended in the video?
2023-12-14 22:17:46 I would like to recommend you the best broker that exists, Multibanks Group. First of all, you quickly solve the registration, you have a bonus on certain deposits. You have your own manager and help in everything. You even have additional opportunities for education and additional earnings with trading. Who is interested in this broker and work on it, here is the link. https://go.mexnetpro.com/visit/?bta=35603&brand=multibankfxaffiliates
2023-12-14 22:19:46 This is only for outside United States, if your in United States use finessefx
2023-12-14 22:21:46 Can you set up a live account on your own or do you wait for your mentor?
2023-12-14 22:21:46 No dear.It is for all not just for outside.
2023-12-14 22:25:46 Of course I can. I solved everything myself. Multibank gives many possibilities and additional earnings. We all choose the way we want to work and through whom.
2023-12-14 22:27:47
