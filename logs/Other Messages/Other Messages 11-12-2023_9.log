2023-12-11 11:52:05 hi
2023-12-11 11:52:06 why I cant set a sell limit
2023-12-11 11:52:06 it shows blank and I cant push it?
2023-12-11 11:54:04 help please
2023-12-11 12:03:05 bc a sell limit needs to be over current price and 1995 is higher than 1992
2023-12-11 12:03:05 thank you
2023-12-11 12:05:05 here’s a wee chart, if it helps
2023-12-11 12:28:05 I just saw the alert from ploutos it came in at 438 this morning. Would it be smart to get in now @1996/1995 for sell price? Or wait for another alert? I trade NY time.
2023-12-11 12:55:06 The trade is still valid 🙂 and actually a better entry
2023-12-11 13:01:06 This community is so great! Thank you!
2023-12-11 14:34:04 How do u get alerts from Ploutos?
2023-12-11 14:39:07 you have to purchase ploutos as an add on
2023-12-11 15:01:08 Friend of mine wants to join your community. Polish speaking would be the best.
2023-12-11 15:06:08 Thank u
2023-12-11 15:07:08 DMed 🙏🏽
2023-12-11 15:24:08 Yeah I just got in at 1987 and made bank! I could see that the trade was still tanking towards take profit, so I made my money even though I didn’t get to start at the top!
2023-12-11 15:25:08 I got in at 1996/1995 and also making bank. Gold is good!
2023-12-11 15:27:08 Yesss we love gold!! 😍🙈
2023-12-11 15:28:08 I want to keep going with gold but can't get greedy
2023-12-11 15:28:08 I know, same ahaha! 🙈👀
2023-12-11 15:28:08 Same 😅
2023-12-11 15:28:08 How much do you have to have in your balance in order to buy or sell gold?
2023-12-11 15:29:08 It's sooooo tempting but I have you resist 🤣
2023-12-11 15:30:08 Shoutout my newest member Jason Ward who is already placing practice trades on his demo and completely crushing it. the expert channels are really awesome for beginners!  He’s such a faster learner and applier. I can’t wait to see him go live 😍
2023-12-11 15:31:08 👏🏼
2023-12-11 15:32:08 500-1000 @ least. From what they recommend
2023-12-11 15:33:09 Closed my last 2 trades out just because I'm learning control and not get greedy. Done for the day!
2023-12-11 15:34:04 Yeah Nic! 🤑
2023-12-11 15:35:08 Thank you my guy!

2023-12-11 16:50:20 HAPPY MONDAY GUYS! Here’s a daily reminder on why I love Mondays! This has been in the books for so long because I used to hate Mondays I used to hate waking up on Mondays but when me telling myself this (in the video) over and over again I’ve changed my hate for Mondays into a love for Mondays!!🙌💕 

It’s all about MINDSET 
LETS KEEP ON PUSHING 💪🏾
2023-12-11 16:51:34 Is anyone receiving trade signals in the chats?
2023-12-11 16:52:09 Anyone in the US, what broker are you using to connect with mt4?
2023-12-11 16:52:09 Use chat support. It happens at times. I personally think the system might just be busy. But it might end up going through later. So please contact support.
2023-12-11 16:53:09 Not much. Don't expect much today. Or too early cause the markets just getting back in the flex.
2023-12-11 16:54:09 YES! Totally love this - Fresh start - New opportunities - New possibilities.
2023-12-11 16:54:54 So true lol I just got excited to practice on my demo account 😂😂
2023-12-11 16:55:31 The limit does not exist here 😁
2023-12-11 16:56:43 Ok thanks, I wasn’t getting trades last week too and I had already reset it and still nothing.
2023-12-11 16:58:10 Is this a constant issue with the chat? Bc it seems that way for me at least. 2-3 days each week I’m not getting anything and have to reset for it to work one day and then I have to do it all over again the next.
2023-12-11 17:27:10 Does anyone know what broker Abdullah is using on the eminus arabic sessions
2023-12-11 17:29:10 The best is to contact Abdullah on IG with blue tick only and the team will link you to broker. But one brokers is Tickmill

2023-12-11 18:38:11 I haven't been able to trade all day because of this stupid broker MASARI CAPITAL...KMT...I'M SOOOO MAD. 😡😡
2023-12-11 18:38:50 How long have you been using this broker for?
2023-12-11 18:41:11 Me ?   About a week and a half maybe 2 weeks.   I used HugosWay and Masari and like it better
2023-12-11 18:58:02 I hope everyone is having a great monday. I am brand new to trading and I'm not sure is it OK to fund my live account? I am still practicing with the demo so I'm not sure what's okay and what isn't okay. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!

2023-12-11 19:13:55 GoodAfternoon. I recommend getting a couple of practice rounds on the demo account before you actually start trading. I’ve learned that initially it’s the challenge isn’t in losing money. It’s in over leveraging yourself.
2023-12-11 19:21:01 
2023-12-11 19:23:06 I get this notification and I don't know what to do. Anyone know how to fixed? I have Elite pack.
2023-12-11 19:23:06 Just exit & log back in
2023-12-11 19:23:18 Okay I try that. I do it again.
2023-12-11 19:24:56 2nd time work it. Thank you Aundrea. 😊
2023-12-11 19:24:56 You’re welcome !
2023-12-11 19:34:05 Looks like I am not going to be able to trade today I cant get into ActDroid tried to contact customer support only to see they are reading my messages but I am getting no reponse then they clase the chat so now have to wait again to get a different agent.
2023-12-11 19:56:12 Me too, 1993 🎉
2023-12-11 20:02:32 I notice that gold lots are different to JPY and the other major pairs…I was nervous what to put as I could only enter the minimum 0.1…worked out ok I got $20AUD! Small win but a win nonetheless 😍
2023-12-11 20:09:46 Today’s trades and it’s only Monday!!
2023-12-11 20:22:13 Damn gold.  I got in at 2007 last night.   Still profitable but…
2023-12-11 20:23:13 Nice but unless you are finding your account with 100k I would get that bank roll down.   

Also keep your lot sizes the same
2023-12-11 20:40:13 Do we know an estimate of when we can connect Eacho with mt5?
2023-12-11 22:08:19 
2023-12-11 22:08:19 On top of that lot size is different to every broker
2023-12-11 22:08:19 🫣🤪 it’s like running the gauntlet sometimes 😆
2023-12-11 22:08:19 What I do trying them on demo then count roughly 1% stop loss
2023-12-11 22:08:19 Is like US30 scalping live session Abdullah doing with 4.00 lot if I want same results I have to do with 40.00 lot
2023-12-11 22:08:19 Hey for anyone thats switched to FinesseFx as their broker, how have your spreads been?
2023-12-11 22:08:19 How have they compared to your previous broker?
2023-12-11 22:08:19 awesome small on the demo account so far, pretty much where you want to enter is where you enter...in the process of organising a live account . previous broker has a spread of 1.5 to 2 pips so way better than my previous broker (city index Australia)
2023-12-11 22:08:19 That’s awesome. thanks for your feedback!
2023-12-11 22:08:19 In Australia you have brilliant broker IC markets 0.0 pips
2023-12-11 22:08:19 i'll check it out thank you, is it regulated?  🙏🏻
2023-12-11 22:08:19 Mine are smaller also
2023-12-11 22:08:19 Yes
2023-12-11 22:08:19 https://www.icmarkets.com.au/en/company/regulation
2023-12-11 22:08:19 What are people’s thoughts on a commission account vs zero commission account with bigger spread on entry?
