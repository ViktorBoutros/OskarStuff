2023-11-30 07:44:16 Do you know how to look at a manara trade and tell if it’s a good trade to take or not.
2023-11-30 07:45:27 ehhh no, I don't. not yet. That employs technical and fundamental analysis, but as far as how to do it, I'm still trying to learn.

2023-11-30 11:00:30 Note your spread when taking trades. Some currency pairs at certain times  have crazy spreads. This used to happen to me as well.
2023-11-30 11:06:26 This is something I need to learn more about too…
2023-11-30 11:06:26 Welcome to the team Anahi. 🤗
2023-11-30 11:25:01 Hi Team- I have Eacho2 connected to my demo account currently. Does this seem right? There is no Stoploss listed on the trade or Take Profit…
2023-11-30 11:25:06 
2023-11-30 11:26:26 
2023-11-30 11:27:05 Shouldn’t there be Stoploss/take profit?
2023-11-30 11:27:38 maybe it does it manually since its scanning 24/7?
2023-11-30 11:28:39 I recall in the onboarding Vimeo he said it would have one and you put in a Stoploss on the backend as a precaution in case a trade ever comes through without one…
2023-11-30 11:29:36 None of the trades have either…
2023-11-30 11:30:18 hm thats weird:/
2023-11-30 11:32:52 I chose Smart Lot Size so I can’t put in Stoploss PIPs- only Risk Management has that option…
2023-11-30 11:33:28 
2023-11-30 11:33:32 
2023-11-30 11:34:19 I guess I’ll watch the demo trades into next week and see…so far even with the losses, still in profit🎉
2023-11-30 11:39:48 @itskarensosa - should we update the currency pairs to the pairs in our Manara settings or just let Eacho trade everything?
2023-11-30 12:19:31 Ok thanks

2023-11-30 13:29:58 it has most likely been talked about but if we have MT5 are we able to use eacho with MT5?
2023-11-30 13:34:33 TP1 and 2 SMASHEDDD🔨🔨🔨
2023-11-30 13:38:33 Thanks for the add
2023-11-30 13:39:37 they said MT4 for Eacho  and MT5 for manual trading
2023-11-30 13:40:27 so i can have MT4 with eacho then i can just manually trade on my MT5? one will be automatically and the other ill be doing myself?

2023-11-30 15:52:36 Can you explained why so I don't make the mistake again?
2023-11-30 16:02:36 From what I can see I believe your stop loss is wrong
2023-11-30 16:02:36 
2023-11-30 16:03:36 You input the stop loss and take profit wrong
2023-11-30 16:12:36 This is one I use
2023-11-30 16:15:36 From what I can see. You’re not inputting the stop loss or take profit correctly.

2023-11-30 16:35:36 Hey guys what's the best leverage and risk management for a $50  live account
2023-11-30 16:38:20 GOOD MORNING FAMILY ⛅️ 

Happy Thursday! Just wanted to drop some gems for everyone 💎


Fear and resistance thrive when we're avoiding the work. Most things aren't as hard or as trying as we chalk them up to be. They're ultimately fun and rewarding and expressions of who we really are. That's why we want them. Taking small steps will remind you that this is true. It will soothe you in a way that just thinking about taking action never will. It's easier to act your way into a new way of thinking rather than think your way into a new way of acting, so do one little thing today and let the momentum build.

And thank whatever force within you that knows there's something bigger for you—the one that's pushing you to be comfortable with less.

2023-11-30 17:13:13 This speaks volumes to me. Lately I’ve truly discovered that having big faith and pairing it with action can move mountains where you once thought things were impossible. Overcoming that fear and doing the things anyway is essential to reach new levels. I’m so happy and grateful for a leader that has such valuable insight and knowledge to share with us. I appreciate you all for being on this journey with me. 🫶🏼

2023-11-30 17:53:38 I’ve applied all the pairs that I like for manara to send me but yet it still sends me tons more that I don’t need, anybody know how why that’s happening? I even did a reset on the Maranda bot and it still didn’t fix it.
2023-11-30 17:53:38 
2023-11-30 18:05:38 Did u save it after you made the changes
2023-11-30 18:16:38 You'll need to flip the t/p n s/l around. Put it in exactly how the send it to you.
2023-11-30 18:20:38 Unclick major and minor in watchlist
2023-11-30 18:33:05 I had a good trade yesterday that my broker ended prematurely. Has anyone else had this happen? Is it common? I still came out ahead but I wanted to let it run to it completion.

2023-11-30 18:53:32 Question for those who got their EACHO set up: I don’t see the VM Action dropdown next to updates on EACHO so currently can’t pick which one to use and setup. Any one else have this issue? How can I get it fixed?
2023-11-30 18:54:22 You clicked the plus at the beginning of the row in front of your account #
2023-11-30 18:54:22 Anybody else having this issue where it’s telling you wrong pin even though you know you used the right one?
2023-11-30 18:54:51 You’re a lifesaver! Thank you so much ❤️
2023-11-30 18:55:39 Refresh the page
2023-11-30 18:56:39 I had that issue a couple days ago. I completely closed out of everything and logged back into my back office and it had me set a new one.
2023-11-30 19:10:39 it was the same to me. i contacted support and they fixed it
2023-11-30 19:10:45 I'm not sure if it was here or another group, but some mentioned about the Notifications on the Manara software.  I see the Telegram icon on the bottom right, but all I have to do is click the icon and start the bot?

2023-11-30 19:24:05 thank you, i knew i had seen something about this..
2023-11-30 19:35:40 Hello everyone I am trying to to deposit on  vantage. I am from Jamaica what zip code should I put there
2023-11-30 19:35:40 It’s not working for me
2023-11-30 19:38:41 if i just set up my eacho today, will it start trading tomorrow?
2023-11-30 19:43:25 should start straight away make sure you refresh your balance so the system is updated should work then
2023-11-30 19:43:25 00000
2023-11-30 19:43:25 Yes same
2023-11-30 19:43:25 U got a loss as well?
2023-11-30 19:43:31 i literally just done that today mysef
2023-11-30 19:44:32 ok thanks
2023-11-30 19:45:39 Also pls SL off for those who can wait for the volatility to calm down. US30 will sink down for sure. As for Nasdaq: please hold on and if price gets back to the entry level we will sell again for a target 15300 and maybe more.
2023-11-30 19:46:35 Wait for a clear new signal for Nasdaq if price at entry again. We booked 100 pips and locked the trade.
2023-11-30 19:47:14 Yes agree, when I unticked major and minor in the watchlist then I entered the pairs I wanted to see in the watchlist under notifications, I started to receive just those pairs
2023-11-30 19:47:27 I did
2023-11-30 19:47:32 Regarding Eacho trading, I was not able to connect my MT4 with Hankotrade.  Has anyone had this issue?
2023-11-30 19:48:40 Can you show what you mean by this by screen shots
2023-11-30 19:49:35 Bull market by bear market sell?
2023-11-30 19:49:35 Buy
2023-11-30 19:49:40 Hit SL with long wick , then went our way
2023-11-30 19:49:56 Has anyone received any trades from Eacho? I know they sent the message out saying that they were working on it and they were extending the auto ship date but I’m just curious if it’s been working for anyone.
2023-11-30 19:51:00 That’s correct. When a bull attacks, it hits up, when a bear attacks, it hits down. Is I believe where the terms came from..at least that’s what I was told.
2023-11-30 19:51:40 Perfect
2023-11-30 19:55:26 Under notifications, select watchlist. Uncheck major and minor then you manually enter the pairs you want to see under symbols 🙏🏻
2023-11-30 19:58:40 Hoping someone can answer this, as I am wondering this same.
2023-11-30 19:58:40 Also check under the Monitor menu that you receive the patterns and timeframes you want to see 🙏🏻
2023-11-30 19:59:40 
2023-11-30 20:00:40 Does anyone know if Eacho is working with Vantage as yet?? 
I know I can submit a request to have the team work on this if not, but this may not happen immediately and I don’t want to be paying for a service I can’t use…
2023-11-30 20:03:40 Honestly, I would wait until you have verification from people that it’s working at all. I have it linked to my MT4 account and haven’t received a single trade yet. I wish I had waited as I’m currently paying for nothing. I talked to support and their response was “[…]we don’t guarantee x amount of trades in a day or week.”
2023-11-30 20:05:35 Eh this is such a shame, everyone was so excited for this product after the launch… very anticlimactic 😕 hopefully they sort it out soon
2023-11-30 20:06:09 Yes same here
2023-11-30 20:06:17 Velkommen Marte ❤️
2023-11-30 20:07:41 Exactly! They I was super excited about it. They hyped it up, saying 80% success rate minimum, 8 different strategies, automated trading…such a let down. I hope it gets sorted soon. If it doesn’t do something but the renewal date, I’m going to cancel it.
2023-11-30 20:10:41 I’m with you there! Definitely not gonna be paying for a service I can’t use, it’s so unfortunate cause I was really looking forward to it, let’s hope it gets sorted soon.
2023-11-30 20:10:41 Word!
2023-11-30 20:13:41 Best to learn how to trade before using an automated system. I enjoy learning this. So much fun especially earning fake money on actual live markets. Sometimes I watch the charts for a straight hour 🤣
2023-11-30 20:14:43 Velkomme!!!!!🎉
2023-11-30 20:16:27 No. Everyone who has Eacho has already connected their MT4 🙌🏾
2023-11-30 20:20:35 Well that’s the point isn’t it? Manara was supposed to make learning to trade easier with the trade ideas so you don’t have to spend years learning all of the trends and patterns and spend hours studying the charts. Then Eacho was supposed to simplify it even more by allowing you to select a strategy and letting the AI choose the trades for you based on its preset algorithm. I work all day, I don’t have the time to sit and watch the charts all day and spend hours before deciding to take a trade lol. I’m doing this for practical reasons, to add income. It’s fun and all earning and losing fake money but at some point I need to take this live and actually earn real money. Without that, it’s just a game like monopoly…just my take but $100 a month is a lot to spend on a game.
2023-11-30 20:23:41 And this is an example why you should learn how to trade through their trainings. Just incase eacho doesn't work. Glad I didn't purchase it yet. Nothing comes easy in life,  don't care if this eacho is a great item for trading. I enjoy the learning experience. But everyone has their own thoughts. Sucks eacho doesn't work
2023-11-30 20:24:41 I also have a job and still find time to learn something new
2023-11-30 20:24:41 But I do hope eacho works when it works because that'll be huge for people
2023-11-30 20:25:29 Are you able to see the trades happening in real time on the mt4 app?
2023-11-30 20:25:41 Agreed
2023-11-30 20:34:15 I connected my MT4 to EACHO and stopped getting trade alerts on the EACHO Telegram. Is there a setting for this?
2023-11-30 20:37:26 velkommen
2023-11-30 20:40:36 Tusen takk! 🥰
2023-11-30 20:40:58 yeah you should be able to, thats what i got told, im also waiting on my trades to start hitting
2023-11-30 20:42:05 Can someone that has experience eacho AI tell me how soon did it take for it to take trades????
2023-11-30 20:43:11 GUYSSS LOOK AT OUR GUY ERICK 🔥🔥😮‍💨 complete beginner as well , fast leaner 🫡  
He is using Manara !! Guys don’t sleep on manara 💰 proud of you Erick 🙌🏽
2023-11-30 20:43:16 
2023-11-30 20:47:07 
2023-11-30 20:47:28 just asked support about not seeing trades and this is what they repsonded with.. 

Please note that Eacho may not generate trades every day, as there are periods when the AI does not identify suitable setups in the market. We do not assert a specific number of trades per day or week; it varies based on market conditions.
2023-11-30 20:48:20 aaaahhhhhh
2023-11-30 20:48:57 yeah that is what they said in the opening of eacho also i guess we trade manually and let the ai take trades
2023-11-30 20:49:38 can u ask support also and see whats the minimum capital/amount we might need for it to take trades please
2023-11-30 20:53:58 Velkomen
2023-11-30 21:00:27 i want to touch on this
2023-11-30 21:00:32 and this
2023-11-30 21:01:27 
2023-11-30 21:02:06 i am following up on this because i didnt know this
2023-11-30 21:03:14 It’s not $1000
2023-11-30 21:03:25 This is incorrect!
2023-11-30 21:03:35 Hassan, our CEO himself said that you can do minimum $150
2023-11-30 21:03:44 Just an FYI

2023-11-30 21:10:07 that is all they said 😐
2023-11-30 21:10:42 Just FYI the times are the top of the graph correspond to my timezone (PST) so they’ll need to be adjusted to other time zones but as far as the information goes, it’s all still accurate. Just the times that correspond to the graph might be different.

2023-11-30 21:11:20 Welcome to the team!!! 🥳
2023-11-30 21:13:42 Is eacho only in the elite pro pack or is it in the elite pro pack as well
2023-11-30 21:14:04 but when your setting up eacho you can choose a fixed lot size so for example if mine is 0.02-0.03 and so on would the ai not use that?

2023-12-01 08:35:19 Hi Krystal
2023-12-01 08:35:19 
2023-12-01 08:35:19 Getting the message above
2023-12-01 08:35:19 Did you go on the “add MetaTrader” tab on the left?
2023-12-01 08:35:19 Yes please
2023-12-01 08:35:19 You have to connect MT4
2023-12-01 08:35:19 Your MT4 login information should be given to you when you connect it to your broker - Hankotrade - via email too if you didn’t save it
2023-12-01 08:35:19 I enter the information they give me
2023-12-01 08:35:19 They send me this and they do put a SL on the AI
2023-12-01 08:35:19 
2023-12-01 08:35:19 Daesiha you have to add it first

2023-12-01 08:35:19 I guess I got a $1.35 profit. When I clicked the dots the one click trading notice came up. Am I supposed to agree to the terms?
2023-12-01 08:35:19 
2023-12-01 08:35:19 This is a manara trade, I just modify my own entry, profit and stop loss

2023-12-03 16:48:59 Hey I'm having trouble logging in to manara. The 6 digit authentication PIN worked on 11/23 but now it doesn't. I chatted with technical to reset my PIN. I was told that I would receive an email when it's done. That was over 24 hours ago and I still can't access manara.

Can someone  help me?
2023-12-03 16:48:59 Hello does anyone know which leverage option to choose on masani? Is it 500?
2023-12-03 16:48:59 200-500
2023-12-03 16:48:59 Anyone know Hanko spread?
2023-12-03 16:48:59 That’s completely up to you. To me 500 is too much risk in taking. I usually stick to 200 with any broker.
2023-12-03 16:48:59 Thank you!!
2023-12-03 16:48:59

2023-12-03 16:48:59 Hey guys pls help me welcome my girl ROSE 💗

My name is Rose (short for Roselyn). I'm 30 years old though i'm still 21 at heart 😂❤️ I currently live in Boston, Mass. My main goal within this trading space is to mold my future with the help of the markets. I don't want to continue into my 30s with the same old 9-5 work with no progress or happiness of what I do. I do have a vision of living freely and traveling about while helping others around me rise up to something better.

Welcome Rose ✨
2023-12-03 16:48:59 @itskarensosa thank you so much!!!
2023-12-03 16:48:59 Thank you so much!✨

2023-12-03 16:48:59 Hello
2023-12-03 16:48:59 Do people in the States use Puprime as a broker ?
2023-12-03 16:48:59 I have someone in the states who just signed up today but can’t download Puprime …
2023-12-03 16:48:59 I’m struggling with linking the broker Masari to Metatrade4
2023-12-03 16:48:59 I have my login info and i type in masari it’s not pulling up masari as the broker
2023-12-03 16:48:59 Masari is no longer on MT4
2023-12-03 16:48:59 Hi everyone blessed Sunday 🙌. This is my first time trading with demo and am new with trading  
Please can someone enlighten me more on the trades and what's going on with is this trade I made 🙈
2023-12-03 16:48:59 It still says the same thing😭
2023-12-03 16:48:59 No problem! Sending to express support with Hassan
2023-12-03 16:48:59 Thanks!!
2023-12-03 16:48:59 This is very good. Very Impressive. I see in this trade you got extremely lucky. Depending on how much your starting with in your trade account it’s best to start with a Micro Lot Size. In the picture your showing us you started with a Standard Lot Size
2023-12-03 16:48:59 The 1.00 in your trade categories tell me that you started your trade on a standard Lot. Depending on how much is in your trade account as a beginner you want to start with a micro Lot. Instead of it being 1.00 it should have been 0.01
2023-12-03 16:48:59 Here are the Lots the team leaders gave all of us. Trade accounts that have between $100-$900 in them should be using Micro Lots. Accounts with $1000-$9000 in them should be using Small Lots, and Accounts with $10,000-$90,000 should be using Standard Lots.
2023-12-03 16:48:59 thats not spreads love thats just what lot size you should use depending on acc size
2023-12-03 16:48:59 Yes. Sorry Lot Size
2023-12-03 16:48:59 Thank you
2023-12-03 16:48:59 Thank you guys so much for the response ❤️
2023-12-03 16:48:59 I had my Hankotrade Demo acct all set up with MT5. Now it’s gone. And when I try and connect it Hankotrade is not listed as a Broker anymore. Any suggestions?
2023-12-03 16:48:59 I’ve tried connecting hankotrade with MT4 for demo for eacho too and it does not show up.
2023-12-03 16:48:59 It gives me a message saying that you’ll need to contact the broker hankotrade about it
2023-12-03 16:48:59 Ok, thought it was just me. It was all connected and I was practicing. So bit quiet sure what happened. Keep me posted if you find a solution 🤗
